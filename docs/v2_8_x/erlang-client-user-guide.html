 <p class="intro">
  This is the programmer's guide to the Erlang AMQP client.
 </p>

 <div class="docSection"><a name="introduction" id="introduction"></a>
   <p>
     The AMQP client provides an Erlang interface to compliant AMQP
     brokers. The client follows the AMQP execution model and
     implements the wire level marshaling required to encode and
     decode AMQP commands in a protocol conformant fashion. AMQP is a
     connection orientated protocol and multiplexes parallel
     interactions via multiple channels within a connection.
   </p>
   <p>
     This user guide assumes that the reader is familiar with basic
     concepts of AMQP and understands exchanges, queues and
     bindings. This information is contained in the protocol
     documentation on the AMQP website. For details and exact
     definitions, please see <a href="http://www.amqp.org/">the AMQP
     specification document</a>.
   </p>
   <p>
     The basic usage of the client follows these broad steps:
     <ol>
       <li>Establish a connection to a broker</li>
       <li>Create a new channel within the open connection</li>
       <li>Execute AMQP commands with a channel such as sending and
       receiving messages, creating exchanges and queue or defining
       routing rules between exchanges and queues</li>
       <li>When no longer required, close the channel and the
       connection</li>
     </ol>
   </p>
   <p>
     Obtain the library source and related materials from the
     <a href="/releases/rabbitmq-erlang-client/v2.8.7/">download directory</a>.
   </p>

 </div>



<div class="docSection"><a name="model" id="model"></a>
  <h2 class="docHeading">Programming Model</h2>
  <p>
    The main two modules in the client library are:
    <ol>
      <li>amqp_connection, which is used to open connections to a
      broker and create channels</li>
      <li>amqp_channel, which is used to send and receive AMQP
      commands</li>
    </ol>
    Once a connection has been established, and a channel has been
    opened, an application will typically use the
    amqp_channel:call/{2,3} and amqp_channel:cast/{2,3} functions to
    achieve most of the things it needs to do.
  </p>
  <p>
    The library is made up of two layers:
    <ol>
      <li>A high level logical layer that follows the AMQP execution
      model</li>
      <li>A low level driver layer that is responsible for providing a
      physical transport to a broker</li>
    </ol>
    There are two drivers in the client library:
    <ol>
      <li>The network driver establishes a TCP connection to a
      protocol compliant AMQP broker and encodes each command
      according to the specification. To use this driver, start a
      connection using amqp_connection:start/1 with the
      parameter set to an #amqp_params_network record.</li>
      <li>The direct driver uses native Erlang messaging instead of
      sending AMQP encoded commands over TCP. This approach avoids the
      overhead of marshaling commands onto and off the wire. However,
      the direct driver can only be used in conjunction with the
      RabbitMQ broker and the client code must be deployed into the
      same Erlang cluster. To use the direct driver, start a
      connection using amqp_connection:start/1 with the
      parameter set to an #amqp_params_direct record.</li>
    </ol>
  </p>
  <p>
    At run-time, the client library re-uses a subset of the
    functionality from the RabbitMQ broker. In order to keep the a
    client deployment independent of RabbitMQ, the client build
    process produces an archive containing all of the common
    modules. This archive is then put onto the load path of the client
    application.
  </p>
  <p>
    For more detailed information on the API, please refer to the
    reference documentation.
  </p>
  <p>
    Furthermore, the test suite that is part of the source
    distribution of the client library contains many complete examples
    of how to program against the API.
  </p>
</div>



<div class="docSection"><a name="commands" id="commands"></a>
  <h2 class="docHeading">AMQP Commands</h2>
  <p>
    The general mechanism of interacting with the broker is to send
    and receive AMQP commands that are defined in the protocol
    documentation. During build process, the machine readable version
    of the AMQP specification is used to auto-generate Erlang records
    for each command. The code generation process also defines
    sensible default values for each command. Using default values
    allows the programmer to write terser code - it is only necessary
    to override a field if you require non-default behaviour. The
    definition of each command can be consulted in the
    rabbit_framing.hrl header file. For example, when using the
    #'exchange.declare'{} command, specifying the following:

    <pre class="sourcecode">
      #'exchange.declare'{exchange = &lt;&lt;"my_exchange"&gt;&gt;}
    </pre>

    is equivalent to this:

    <pre class="sourcecode">
      #'exchange.declare'{exchange    = &lt;&lt;"my_exchange"&gt;&gt;,
                          ticket      = 0,
                          type        = &lt;&lt;"direct"&gt;&gt;,
                          passive     = false,
                          durable     = false,
                          auto_delete = false,
                          internal    = false,
                          nowait      = false,
                          arguments   = []}
    </pre>
  </p>
</div>



<div class="docSection"><a name="headers" id="headers"></a>
  <h2 class="docHeading">Including Header Files</h2>
  <p>
    The Erlang client uses a number of record definitions which you
    will encounter in this guide. These records fall into two broad
    categories:

    <ol>
      <li>Auto-generated AMQP command definitions from the machine
      readable version of the specification</li>
      <li>Definitions of data structures that are commonly used
      throughout the client</li>
    </ol>

    To gain access to these records, you need to include the
    amqp_client.hrl in every module that uses the Erlang client:

    <pre class="sourcecode">
      -include("amqp_client.hrl").
    </pre>
  </p>
</div>



<div class="docSection"><a name="connections" id="connections"></a>
  <h2 class="docHeading">Connecting To A Broker</h2>
  <p>
    The amqp_connection module is used to start a connection to the
     broker:

     <pre class="sourcecode">
       {ok, Connection} = amqp_connection:start(#amqp_params_network{})
     </pre>
  </p>
  <p>
    This function returns {ok, Connection}, where Connection is the
    pid of a process that maintains a permanent connection to the
    broker.
  </p>
  <p>
    In case of an error, the above call returns {error, Error}.
  </p>
  <p>
    An AMQP broker contains objects organised into groups called
    virtual hosts. The concept of virtual hosts gives an administrator
    the facility to partition a broker resource into separate domains
    and restrict access to the objects contained within these
    groups. AMQP connections require client authentication and the
    authorisation to access specific virtual hosts.
    </p>
    <p>
      The #amqp_params_network record sets the following default values:
    </p>
    <table>
      <tr><th>Parameter</th><th>Default Value</th></tr>
      <tr><td>username</td><td>guest</td></tr>
      <tr><td>password</td><td>guest</td></tr>
      <tr><td>virtual_host</td><td>/</td></tr>
      <tr><td>host</td><td>localhost</td></tr>
      <tr><td>port</td><td>5672</td></tr>
      <tr><td>channel_max</td><td>0</td></tr>
      <tr><td>frame_max</td><td>0</td></tr>
      <tr><td>heartbeat</td><td>0</td></tr>
      <tr><td>ssl_options</td><td>none</td></tr>
      <tr><td>auth_mechanisms</td><td>[fun
      amqp_auth_mechanisms:plain/3, fun
      amqp_auth_mechanisms:amqplain/3]</td></tr>
      <tr><td>client_properties</td><td>[ ]</td></tr>
    </table>
    <p>
      These values are only the defaults that will work with an out of
      the box broker running on the same host. If the broker or the
      environment has been configured differently, these values can be
      overridden to match the actual deployment scenario.
    </p>
    <p>
      If a client wishes to run inside the same Erlang cluster as the
      RabbitMQ broker, it can start a direct connection that optimises
      away the AMQP codec. To start a direct connection, use
      amqp_connection:start/1 with the parameter set to
      an #amqp_params_direct record.
    </p>
    <p>
      The #amqp_params_direct record sets the following default values:
    </p>
    <table>
      <tr><th>Parameter</th><th>Default Value</th></tr>
      <tr><td>username</td><td>guest</td></tr>
      <tr><td>virtual_host</td><td>/</td></tr>
      <tr><td>node</td><td>node()</td></tr>
      <tr><td>client_properties</td><td>[ ]</td></tr>
    </table>
</div>
<div class="docSection"><a name="amqp-uris" id="amqp-uris"></a>
  <h2 class="docHeading">Connecting To A Broker with AMQP URIs</h2>
  <p>
    Instead of working the #amqp_params_* records directly, <a href="uri-spec.html">AMQP URIs</a> may be used.  The
    amqp_uri:parse/1 function is provided for this purpose.  It parses
    an URI and returns the equivalent #amqp_params_* record.
    Diverging from the spec, if the hostname is omitted, the
    connection is assumed to be direct and an #amqp_params_direct{}
    record is returned.  In addition to the standard host, port, user,
    password and vhost parameters, extra parameters may be specified
    via the query string (e.g. "?heartbeat=5").
  </p>
</div>
<div class="docSection"><a name="channels" id="channels"></a>
  <h2 class="docHeading">Creating Channels</h2>
  <p>
    Once a connection to the broker has been established, the
    amqp_connection module can be used to create channels:

    <pre class="sourcecode">
      {ok, Channel} = amqp_connection:open_channel(Connection)
    </pre>

    This function takes the pid of the connection process and returns
    {ok, Channel}, where Channel is a pid that encapsulates a server
    side channel.
  </p>
</div>

<div class="docSection"><a name="exchanges_queues" id="exchanges_queues"></a>
  <h2 class="docHeading">Managing Exchanges And Queues</h2>
  <p>
    Once a channel has been established, the amqp_channel module can
    be used to manage the fundamental objects within AMQP, namely
    exchanges and queues. The following function creates an exchange
    called my_exchange, which by default, is the direct exchange:

    <pre class="sourcecode">
      Declare = #'exchange.declare'{exchange = &lt;&lt;"my_exchange"&gt;&gt;},
      #'exchange.declare_ok'{} = amqp_channel:call(Channel, Declare)
    </pre>

    Similarly, a queue called my_queue is created by this code:

    <pre class="sourcecode">
      Declare = #'queue.declare'{queue = &lt;&lt;"my_queue"&gt;&gt;},
      #'queue.declare_ok'{} = amqp_channel:call(Channel, Declare)
    </pre>

    In many scenarios, a client is not interested in the actual name
    of the queue it wishes to receive messages from. In this case, it
    is possible to let the broker generate a random name for a
    queue. To do this, send a #'queue.declare'{} command and leave the
    queue attribute undefined:

    <pre class="sourcecode">
      #'queue.declare_ok'{queue = Queue} = amqp_channel:call(Channel, #'queue.declare'{})
    </pre>

    The server will auto-generate a queue name and return this name as
    part of the acknowledgement.
  </p>

  <p>
    To create a routing rule from an exchange to a queue, the
    #'queue.bind'{} command is used:

    <pre class="sourcecode">
      Binding = #'queue.bind'{queue       = Queue,
                              exchange    = Exchange,
                              routing_key = RoutingKey},
      #'queue.bind_ok'{} = amqp_channel:call(Channel, Binding)
    </pre>

    When this routing rule is no longer required, this route can be
    deleted using the #'queue.unbind'{} command:

    <pre class="sourcecode">
      Binding = #'queue.unbind'{queue       = Queue,
                                exchange    = Exchange,
                                routing_key = RoutingKey},
      #'queue.unbind_ok'{} = amqp_channel:call(Channel, Binding)
    </pre>

    An exchange can be deleted by the #'exchange.delete'{} command:

    <pre class="sourcecode">
      Delete = #'exchange.delete'{exchange = &lt;&lt;"my_exchange"&gt;&gt;},
      #'exchange.delete_ok'{} = amqp_channel:call(Channel, Delete)
    </pre>

    Similarly, a queue is deleted using the #'queue.delete'{} command:

    <pre class="sourcecode">
      Delete = #'queue.delete'{queue = &lt;&lt;"my_queue"&gt;&gt;},
      #'queue.delete_ok'{} = amqp_channel:call(Channel, Delete)
    </pre>
  </p>

  <p>
    Note that we used amqp_channel:call/2 in the examples above, since
    we sent AMQP synchronous methods. It is generally advisable to use
    amqp_channel:call/{2,3} for synchronous methods, rather than
    amqp_channel:cast/{2,3}, even though both functions work with both
    sync and async method types. The difference between the two
    functions is that amqp_channel:call/{2,3} blocks the calling
    process until the reply comes back from the server (for sync
    methods) or the method has been sent on the wire (for async
    methods), whereas amqp_channel:cast/{2,3} returns 'ok'
    immediately. Thus, only by using amqp_channel:call/{2,3} can we
    check that the broker has acknowledged our command.
  </p>
</div>



<div class="docSection"><a name="sending" id="sending"></a>
  <h2 class="docHeading">Sending Messages</h2>
  <p>
    To send a message to an exchange with a particular routing key,
    the #'basic.publish'{} command in conjunction with the #amqp_msg{}
    record is used:

    <pre class="sourcecode">
      Payload = &lt;&lt;"foobar"&gt;&gt;,
      Publish = #'basic.publish'{exchange = X, routing_key = Key},
      amqp_channel:cast(Channel, Publish, #amqp_msg{payload = Payload})
    </pre>

    By default, the properties field of the #amqp_msg{} record
    contains a minimal implementation of the #'P_basic'{} properties
    structure. If an application needs to override any of the
    defaults, for example, to send persistent messages, the
    #amqp_msg{} needs to be constructed accordingly:

    <pre class="sourcecode">
      Payload = &lt;&lt;"foobar"&gt;&gt;,
      Publish = #'basic.publish'{exchange = X, routing_key = Key},
      Props = #'P_basic'{delivery_mode = 2}, %% persistent message
      Msg = #amqp_msg{props = Props, payload = Payload},
      amqp_channel:cast(Channel, Publish, Msg)
    </pre>

    The full list of message headers is explained in the AMQP protocol
    documentation.

  </p>
  <p>
    Remember that the AMQP #'basic.publish' command is
    asynchronous. This means that the server will not send a response
    to it, unless the message is not deliverable.  In this case, the
    message will be returned to the client. This operation is
    described in the <a href="#returns">handling returns</a> section.
  </p>
</div>



<div class="docSection"><a name="receiving" id="receiving"></a>
  <h2 class="docHeading">Receiving Messages</h2>
  <p>
    The simplest way to receive a message is to poll an existing
    queue. This is achieved using the #'basic.get'{} command:

    <pre class="sourcecode">
      Get = #'basic.get'{queue = Q, no_ack = true},
      {#'basic.get_ok'{}, Content} = amqp_channel:call(Channel, Get),
      #amqp_msg{payload = Payload} = Content
    </pre>

    The payload that is returned is an Erlang binary, and it is up to
    the application to decode it, as the structure of this content is
    opaque to the AMQP protocol.
  </p>

  <p>
    If the queue were empty when the #'basic.get'{} command was
    invoked, then the channel will return an #'basic.get_empty'
    message, as illustrated here:

    <pre class="sourcecode">
     #'basic.get_empty'{} = amqp_channel:call(Channel, Get)
    </pre>

  </p>

  <p>
    Note that the previous example sets the no_ack flag on the
    #'basic.get'{} command. This tells the broker that the receiver
    will not send an acknowledgement of the message. In doing so, the
    broker can absolve itself of the responsibility for delivery -
    once it believes it has delivered a message, then it is free to
    assume that consuming application has taken responsibility for
    it. In general, a lot of applications will not want these
    semantics, rather, they will want to explicitly acknowledge the
    receipt of a message. This is done with the #'basic.ack'{}
    command, where the no_ack field is turned off by default:

    <pre class="sourcecode">
      Get = #'basic.get'{queue = Q},
      {#'basic.get_ok'{delivery_tag = Tag}, Content}
          = amqp_channel:call(Channel, Get),
      %% Do something with the message payload.......and then ack it
      amqp_channel:cast(Channel, #'basic.ack'{delivery_tag = Tag})
    </pre>
  </p>

  <p>
    Notice that we sent the #'basic.ack'{} command using
    amqp_channel:cast/2 instead of amqp_channel:call/2. This is
    because the broker will not send a response to an acknowledgement,
    i.e. it is a fire and forget command.
  </p>

  <p>
    Receiving messages by polling a queue is not as as efficient as
    subscribing a consumer to a queue, so consideration should be
    taken when receiving large volumes of messages.
  </p>
</div>



<div class="docSection"><a name="subscribing" id="subscribing"></a>
  <h2 class="docHeading">Subscribing To Queues</h2>
  <p>
    As indicated in the "Receiving Messages" section, subscribing to a
    queue can be a more efficient means of consuming messages than
    the polling mechanism. To subscribe to a queue, the
    #'basic.consume'{} command is used in one of two forms:

    <pre class="sourcecode">
      Sub = #'basic.consume'{queue = Q},
      #'basic.consume_ok'{consumer_tag = Tag} = amqp_channel:subscribe(Channel, Sub, Consumer)
    </pre>

    or

    <pre class="sourcecode">
      Sub = #'basic.consume'{queue = Q},
      #'basic.consume_ok'{consumer_tag = Tag} = amqp_channel:call(Channel, Sub) %% the caller is the subscriber
    </pre>
  </p>
  <p>
    The consumer argument is the pid of a process to which the client
    library will deliver messages. This can be an arbitrary Erlang
    process, including the process that initiated the
    subscription. The #'basic.consume_ok'{} notification contains a
    tag that identifies the subscription. This is used at a later
    point in time to cancel the subscription. This notification is
    sent both to the process that created the subscription (as the
    return value to amqp_channel:subscribe/3) and as a message to the
    consumer process.
  </p>
  <p>
    When a consumer process is subscribed to a queue, it will receive
    messages in its mailbox. An example receive loop looks like this:

    <pre class="sourcecode">
      loop(Channel) -&gt;
          receive
              %% This is the first message received
              #'basic.consume_ok'{} -&gt;
                  loop(Channel);

              %% This is received when the subscription is cancelled
              #'basic.cancel_ok'{} -&gt;
                  ok;

              %% A delivery
              {#'basic.deliver'{delivery_tag = Tag}, Content} -&gt;
                  %% Do something with the message payload
                  %% (some work here)

                  %% Ack the message
                  amqp_channel:cast(Channel, #'basic.ack'{delivery_tag = Tag}),

                  %% Loop
                  loop(Channel)
          end.
     </pre>

     In this simple example, the process consumes the subscription
     notification and then proceeds to wait for delivery messages to
     arrive in its mailbox. When messages are received from the
     mailbox, the loop does something useful with the message and
     sends a receipt acknowledge back to the broker. If the
     subscription is cancelled, either by the consumer itself or some
     other process, a cancellation notification will be sent to the
     consumer process. In this scenario, the receive loop just
     exits. If the application does not wish to explicitly acknowledge
     message receipts, it should set the no_ack flag on the
     subscription request.
    </p>

    To cancel a subscription, use the tag that the broker passed back
    with the #'basic.consume_ok'{} acknowledgement:

    <pre class="sourcecode">

  <h2 class="docHeading">Subscribing Internals</h2>
  <p>The channel uses a module implementing the amqp_gen_consumer
  behaviour to determine its behaviour with regard to subscribing
  related events.  Effectively, this modules handles client-side
  consumer registration and routing of deliveries to the appropriate
  consumers.</p>

  <p>For instance, the default consumer module,
  amqp_selective_consumer, keeps track of which processes are
  subscribed to which queues and routes deliveries appropriately; in
  addition, if the channel gives it a delivery for an unknown
  consumer, it will pass it to a default consumer, should one be
  registered.</p>

  <p>By contrast, amqp_direct_consumer simply forwards all the
  messages it receives from the channel to its only registered
  consumer.</p>

  <p>The consumer module for a channel is chosen when the channel is
  opened by setting the second parameter to
  amqp_connection:open_channel/2.  The consumer module implements the
  amqp_gen_consumer behaviour and thus implements functions to handle
  receiving basic.consume, basic.consume_ok, basic.cancel,
  basic.cancel_ok methods as well as publishes.</p>

  <p>See the API documentation for details.</p>

<div class="docSection"><a name="closing" id="closing"></a>

  <h2 class="docHeading">Closing Channels And The Connection</h2>
  <p>
      When a channel is no longer required, a client should close
      it. This is achieved using amqp_channel:close/1:

      <pre class="sourcecode">
        amqp_channel:close(Channel)
      </pre>

      To close the connection, amqp_connection:close/1 is used:

      <pre class="sourcecode">
        amqp_connection:close(Connection)
      </pre>

  </p>
  <p>
    Both the #'channel.close'{} and #'connection.close'{} commands
    take the arguments reply_code (an integer) and reply_text (binary
    text), which can be set by the client depending on the reason why
    the channel or connection is being closed. In general, however,
    the reply_code is set to 200 to indicate a normal shutdown. The
    reply_text attribute is just an arbitrary string, that the server
    may or may not log. If a client wants to set to a different reply
    code and/or text, it can use the overloaded functions
    amqp_channel:close/3 and amqp_connection:close/3 respectively.

  </p>
</div>



<div class="docSection"><a name="example" id="example"></a>
  <h2 class="docHeading">Complete Example</h2>
  <p>

    This shows a complete example:

    <pre class="sourcecode">
      -module(amqp_example).

      -include("amqp_client.hrl").

      -compile([export_all]).

      test() -&gt;
          %% Start a network connection
          {ok, Connection} = amqp_connection:start(#amqp_params_network{}),
          %% Open a channel on the connection
          {ok, Channel} = amqp_connection:open_channel(Connection),

          %% Declare a queue
          #'queue.declare_ok'{queue = Q}
              = amqp_channel:call(Channel, #'queue.declare'{}),

          %% Publish a message
          Payload = &lt;&lt;"foobar"&gt;&gt;,
          Publish = #'basic.publish'{exchange = &lt;&lt;&gt;&gt;, routing_key = Q},
          amqp_channel:cast(Channel, Publish, #amqp_msg{payload = Payload}),

          %% Get the message back from the queue
          Get = #'basic.get'{queue = Q},
          {#'basic.get_ok'{delivery_tag = Tag}, Content}
               = amqp_channel:call(Channel, Get),

          %% Do something with the message payload
          %% (some work here)

          %% Ack the message
          amqp_channel:cast(Channel, #'basic.ack'{delivery_tag = Tag}),

          %% Close the channel
          amqp_channel:close(Channel),
          %% Close the connection
          amqp_connection:close(Connection),

          ok.
    </pre>

    In this example, a queue is created with a server generated name
    and a message is published directly to the queue. This makes use
    of the fact that every queue is bound to the default exchange via
    its own queue name. The message is then dequeued and acknowledged.

<div class="docSection"><a name="deployment" id="deployment"></a>
  <h2 class="docHeading">Client Deployment</h2>

  <p>
    The client build process produces two deployment archives:

    <ol>
      <li>amqp_client.ez, which contains all of the AMQP client
      modules</li>
      <li>rabbit_common.ez, which contains the common modules from the
      server that are required at run-time</li>
    </ol>

    In order to use the client at run-time, you need to put both these
    archives onto the load path of your application. This can be done
    either by setting the ERL_LIBS variable to point at the directory
    that contains these archives or by referencing their containing
    directory with the -pa argument to the Erlang interpreter.
  </p>

  <p>
    Say you were to put both amqp_client.ez and rabbit_common.ez into
    a directory called deps. To compile the example, you first need to
    unpack the archives in the deps directory:

    <pre class="sourcecode">
      $ unzip -d deps deps/amqp_client.ez
      $ unzip -d deps deps/rabbit_common.ez
    </pre>

    Then to compile the example code into the ebin directory:

    <pre class="sourcecode">
      $ ERL_LIBS=deps erlc -o ebin amqp_example.erl
    </pre>

    And then to run your application you could set the Erlang run-time like this:

    <pre class="sourcecode">
      $ ERL_LIBS=deps erl -pa ebin
      Erlang R13B01 (erts-5.7.2) [source] [64-bit] [smp:4:4] [rq:4] [async-threads:0] [kernel-poll:false]

      Eshell V5.7.2  (abort with ^G)
      1&gt; amqp_example:test().
      ok
      2&gt;
    </pre>
  </p>

</div>



<div class="docSection"><a name="flow" id="flow"></a>
  <h2 class="docHeading">Egress Flow Control</h2>
  <p>
    By default, there is no flow control within a channel other than
    normal TCP back-pressure. A consumer can set the size of the
    prefetch buffer that the broker will maintain for outstanding
    unacknowledged messages on a single channel. This is achieved
    using the #'basic.qos'{} command:

    <pre class="sourcecode">
      amqp_channel:call(Channel, #'basic.qos'{prefetch_count = Prefetch})
    </pre>

    Applications typically set the prefetch count to 1, which means
    the processing speed of the consumer exerts complete back-pressure
    on the flow of messages in that channel.

  </p>
</div>



<div class="docSection"><a name="flow" id="flow"></a>
  <h2 class="docHeading">Ingress Flow Control</h2>

  <p>
    When an AMQP broker is running low on resources, for example by
    hitting a memory high watermark, it may choose to throttle
    producers by sending a #'channel.flow'{} command to connected
    clients. This is a reverse RPC method, i.e. the server sends a
    command to the client and expects a response. The client library
    handles this on behalf of the application and make sure that no
    further messages be sent until the server signals that messaging
    can resume. In order for the application to be aware that
    throttling has taken place, it is necessary for the application to
    register a callback process:

    <pre class="sourcecode">
      amqp_channel:register_flow_handler(Channel, FlowHandler)
    </pre>

    The flow handling process will receive the following message in
    its mailbox when the server throttles ingress:

    <pre class="sourcecode">
      receive
          #'channel.flow'{active = false} -&gt; %% Throttle the application
      end
    </pre>

    When the broker decides that messaging can resume, the flow
    handler will receive this message:

    <pre class="sourcecode">
      receive
          #'channel.flow'{active = true} -&gt; %% Resume message sending
      end
    </pre>

   </p>
</div>




<div class="docSection"><a name="returns" id="returns"></a>
  <h2 class="docHeading">Handling Returned Messages</h2>

   <p>
     The broker will return undeliverable messages back to the
     originating client. These are messages published either with the
     immediate or mandatory flags set. In order for the application to
     get notified of a return, it must register a callback process
     that can process #'basic.return'{} commands. Here is an example
     of unrouteable message:

     <pre class="sourcecode">
       amqp_channel:register_return_handler(Channel, self()),
       amqp_channel:call(Channel, #'exchange.declare'{exchange = X}),
       Publish = #'basic.publish'{exchange = X, routing_key = SomeKey,
                                  mandatory = true},
       amqp_channel:call(Channel, Publish, #amqp_msg{payload = Payload}),
       receive
           {BasicReturn, Content} -&gt;
               #'basic.return'{reply_text = &lt;&lt;"unroutable"&gt;&gt;, exchange = X} = BasicReturn
               %% Do something with the returned message
       end
     </pre>
   </p>
