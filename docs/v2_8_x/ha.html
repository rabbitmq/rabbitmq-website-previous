        <p>
          If your RabbitMQ broker consists of a single node, then a
          failure of that node will cause downtime, temporary
          unavailability of service, and potentially loss of messages
          (especially non-persistent messages held by non-durable
          queues). You could publish all messages persistent, to
          durable queues, but even then, due to buffering there is an
          amount of time between the message being sent and the
          message being written to disk and fsync'd. Using <a href="confirms.html">publisher confirms</a> is
          one means to ensure the client understands which messages
          have been written to disk, but even so, you may not wish to
          suffer the downtime and inconvenience of the unavailability
          of service caused by a node failure, or the performance
          degradation of having to write every message to disk.
        </p>
        <p>
          You could use a <a href="clustering.html">cluster</a> of
          RabbitMQ nodes to construct your RabbitMQ broker. This will
          be resilient to the loss of individual nodes in terms of the
          overall availability of service, but some important caveats
          apply: whilst exchanges and bindings survive the loss of
          individual nodes, queues and their messages do not. This is
          because a queue and its contents reside on exactly one node,
          thus the loss of a node will render its queues unavailable.
        </p>
        <p>
          You could use an <a href="pacemaker.html">active/passive</a>
          pair of nodes such that should one node fail, the passive
          node will be able to come up and take over from the failed
          node. This can even be combined with clustering. Whilst this
          approach ensures that failures are quickly detected and
          recovered from, there can be reasons why the passive node
          can take a long time to start up, or potentially even fail
          to start. This can cause at best, temporary unavailability
          of queues which were located on the failed node.
        </p>
        <p>
          To solve these various problems, we have developed
          active/active high availability for queues. This works by
          allowing queues to be <i>mirrored</i> on other nodes within
          a RabbitMQ cluster. The result is that should one node of a
          cluster fail, the queue can automatically switch to one of
          the mirrors and continue to operate, with no unavailability
          of service. This solution still requires a RabbitMQ cluster,
          which means that it will not cope seamlessly with network
          partitions within the cluster and, for that reason, is not
          recommended for use across a WAN (though of course, clients
          can still connect from as near and as far as needed).
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="docSection"><a name="behaviour" id="behaviour"></a>
        <h2 class="docHeading">Mirrored Queue Behaviour</h2>
        <p>
          In normal operation, for each mirrored-queue, there is one
          <i>master</i> and several <i>slaves</i>, each on a
          different node. The slaves apply the operations that occur
          to the master in exactly the same order as the master and
          thus maintain the same state. All actions other than
          publishes go only to the master, and the master then
          broadcasts the effect of the actions to the slaves. Thus
          clients consuming from a mirrored queue are in fact
          consuming from the master.
        </p>
        <p>
          Should a slave fail, there is little to be done other than
          some bookkeeping: the master remains the master and no
          client need take any action or be informed of the failure.
        </p>
        <p>
          If the master fails, then one of the slaves must be
          promoted. At this point, the following happens:
          <ol>
            <li>A slave is promoted to become the new master. The
            slave chosen for promotion is the eldest slave. As such,
            it has the best chance of being synchronised with the
            master. However, note that should there be no slave that
            is <a href="#unsynchronised-slaves">synchronised</a> with
            the master, messages that only the master held will be
            lost.</li>

            <li>The slave considers all previous consumers to have
            been abruptly disconnected. As such, it requeues all
            messages that have been delivered to clients but are
            pending acknowledgement. This can include messages for
            which a client has issued acknowledgements: either the
            acknowledgement was lost on the wire before reaching the
            master, or it was lost during broadcast from the master to
            the slaves. In either case, the new master has no choice
            but to requeue all messages it thinks have not been
            acknowledged.</li>

            <li>Clients that were consuming from the mirrored-queue
            and support our <a href="consumer-cancel.html">Consumer
            Cancellation Notifications</a> extension will receive a
            notification that their subscription to the mirrored-queue
            has been abruptly cancelled. At this point they should
            re-consume from the queue, which will pick up the new
            master. The reason for sending this notification is that
            informing clients of the loss of the master is essential:
            otherwise the client may continue to issue
            acknowledgements for messages they were sent by the old,
            failed master, and not expect that they might be about to
            see the same messages again, this time sent by the new
            master. Of course, clients that were connected to the
            failed node will find their connections failed, and will
            need to reconnect to a surviving node of the cluster.</li>

            <li><i>As a result of the requeuing, clients that
            re-consume from the queue <b>must</b> be aware that they
            are likely to subsequently receive messages that they have
            seen previously.</i></li>
          </ol>
        </p>
        <p>
          As the chosen slave becomes the master, no messages that are
          published to the mirrored-queue during this time will be
          lost: messages published to a mirrored-queue are always
          published directly to the master and all slaves. Thus should
          the master fail, the messages continue to be sent to the
          slaves and will be added to the queue once the promotion of
          a slave to the master completes.
        </p>
        <p>
          Similarly, messages published by clients using <a href="confirms.html">publisher confirms</a> will
          still be confirmed correctly even if the master (or any
          slaves) fail between the message being published and the
          message being able to be confirmed to the publisher. Thus
          from the point of view of the publisher, publishing to a
          mirrored-queue is no different from publishing to any other
          sort of queue. It is only consumers that need to be aware of
          the possibility of needing to re-consume from a
          mirrored-queue upon receipt of a <a href="consumer-cancel.html">Consumer
          Cancellation Notification</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you are consuming from a mirrored-queue with
          <i>noAck=true</i> (i.e. the client is not sending message
          acknowledgements) then messages can be lost. This is no
          different from the norm of course: the broker considers a
          message <i>acknowledged</i> as soon as it has been sent to a
          <i>noAck=true</i> consumer, and should the client disconnect
          abruptly, the message may never be received. In the case of
          a mirrored-queue, should the master die, messages that are
          in-flight on their way to <i>noAck=true</i> consumers may
          never be received by those clients, and will not be requeued
          by the new master. Because of the possibility that the
          consuming client is connected to a node that survives, the
          <a href="consumer-cancel.html">Consumer
          Cancellation Notification</a> is useful in identifying when
          such events may have occurred. Of course, in practise, if
          you care about not losing messages then you are advised to
          consume with <i>noAck=false</i>.
        </p>
        <div class="docSubsection"><a name="confirms-transactions" id="confirms-transactions"></a>
          <h3 class="docHeading">Publisher Confirms and Transactions</h3>
          <p>
            Mirrored queues support both <a href="confirms.html">Publisher Confirms</a> and
            <a href="specification.html#tx">Transactions</a>. The
            semantics chosen are that in the case of both confirms and
            transactions, the action spans all mirrors of the
            queue. So in the case of a transaction, a
            <span class="code ">tx.commit-ok</span> will only be returned to a
            client when the transaction has been applied across all
            mirrors of the queue. Equally, in the case of publisher
            confirms, a message will only be confirmed to the
            publisher when it has been accepted by all of the
            mirrors. It is correct to think of the semantics as being
            the same as a message being routed to multiple normal
            queues, and of a transaction with publications within
            that similarly are routed to multiple queues.

      <div class="docSection"><a name="unsynchronised-slaves" id="unsynchronised-slaves"></a>
        <h2 class="docHeading">Unsynchronised Slaves</h2>
        <p>
          A node may join a cluster at any time. Depending on the
          configuration of a queue, when a node joins a cluster,
          queues may add a slave on the new node. At this point, the
          new slave will be empty: it will not contain any existing
          contents of the queue, and currently, there is no
          synchronisation protocol. Such a slave will receive new
          messages published to the queue, and thus over time will
          accurately represent the tail of the mirrored-queue. As
          messages are drained from the mirrored-queue, the size of
          the head of the queue for which the new slave is missing
          messages, will shrink until eventually the slave's contents
          precisely match the master's contents. At this point, the
          slave can be considered fully synchronised, but it is
          important to note that this has occured because of actions
          of clients in terms of draining the pre-existing head of the
          queue.
        </p>
        <p>
          Thus a newly added slave provides no additional form of
          redundancy or availability of the queue's contents until the
          contents of the queue that existed before the slave was
          added have been removed.  As a result of this, it is
          preferable to bring up all nodes on which slaves will exist
          prior to creating mirrored queues, or even better to ensure
          that your use of messaging generally results in very short
          or empty queues that rapidly drain.
        </p>
        <p>
          You can determine which slaves have synchronised with the
          following rabbitmqctl invocation, or through the management
          plugin:
        </p>
        <pre class="sourcecode">rabbitmqctl list_queues name slave_pids synchronised_slave_pids</pre>
      </div>

      <div class="docSection"><a name="start-stop" id="start-stop"></a>
        <h2 class="docHeading">Starting and Stopping Nodes</h2>
        <p>
          If you stop a RabbitMQ node which contains the master of a
          mirrored-queue, some slave on some other node will be
          promoted to the master (assuming there is one). If you
          continue to stop nodes then you will reach a point where a
          mirrored-queue has no more slaves: it exists only on one
          node, which is now its master.  If the mirrored-queue was
          declared <i>durable</i> then, if its last remaining node is
          shutdown, durable messages in the queue will survive the
          restart of that node. In general, as you restart other
          nodes, if they were previously part of a mirrored-queue then
          they will rejoin the mirrored queue.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, there is currently no way for a slave to know
          whether or not its queue contents have diverged from the
          master to which it is rejoining (this could happen during a
          network partition, for example). As such, when a slave
          rejoins a mirrored-queue, it throws away any durable local
          contents it already has and starts empty. Its behaviour is
          at this point the same as if it were a <a href="#unsynchronised-slaves">new node joining the
          cluster</a>.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="docSection"><a name="genesis" id="genesis"></a>
        <h2 class="docHeading">Creating a Mirrored Queue</h2>
        <p>
          A mirrored-queue must be created as a mirrored-queue. It is
          not possible to convert a non-mirrored-queue to a
          mirrored-queue at some later point. It is perfectly
          acceptable to create a mirrored-queue with no slaves
          initially, though be aware of the behaviour of <a href="#unsynchronised-slaves">adding nodes to a cluster</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          To create a mirrored-queue, you provide an
          <span class="code ">x-ha-policy</span> entry in the argument table
          presented to <span class="code ">queue.declare</span>. The value of this
          entry is a <span class="code ">long string</span> which gives the name of
          the policy you wish to use for this queue. There are
          currently two policies available:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><span class="code ">all</span>: This policy ensures that a mirror of
          the queue will exist on every node in the cluster. When a
          new node joins the cluster, a mirror of the queue will be
          created on the new node. The queue's initial master will be
          on the node to which the client issuing the queue declare is
          connected.</li>

          <li><span class="code ">nodes</span>: This policy allows you to specify
          the exact nodes on which you wish mirrors to exist. To do
          this, you provide an additional entry in the arguments
          table, with a key of <span class="code ">x-ha-policy-params</span>, and a
          value which is an array of <span class="code ">long strings</span>, each
          of which is a <i>node name</i>. The queue's initial master
          will be the first node in the list (and thus this node
          <b>must</b> exist and be reachable, even if it is not the
          node to which the client is connected), and slaves are
          created on the remaining nodes in the list. With this
          policy, you may declare a mirrored-queue with mirrors on a
          subset of the nodes in a cluster. You may also declare a
          mirrored-queue with slaves on nodes which are not currently
          members of the cluster: when such nodes join the cluster, a
          slave will automatically be created of the queue on that
          node. Note however that the mirror on the newly joined node
          will <a href="#unsynchronised-slaves">behave as a new
          slave</a>.  Also note that it is the <i>node-names</i> that
          must provided, not host-name or IP address. It is an error
          to supply an empty array as the value of the
          <span class="code ">x-ha-policy-params</span> entry: the array must
          contain at least one element.</li>

        </ul>
        <p>Some examples:
          <pre class="sourcecode">
Map&lt;String, Object&gt; args = new HashMap&lt;String, Object&gt;();
args.put("x-ha-policy", "all");
channel.queueDeclare("myqueue", false, false, false, args);</pre>

          This declares a queue <span class="code ">myqueue</span> which has a mirror on every node that is in the cluster or joins the cluster.

          <pre class="sourcecode">
Map&lt;String, Object&gt; args = new HashMap&lt;String, Object&gt;();
args.put("x-ha-policy", "nodes");
args.put("x-ha-policy-params", Arrays.asList("node1@rabbit", "node2@rabbit", "node4@rabbit"));
channel.queueDeclare("myqueue", false, false, false, args);</pre>

          This declares a queue <span class="code ">myqueue</span> which has a
          mirror on each of the nodes <span class="code ">node1@rabbit</span>,
          <span class="code ">node2@rabbit</span> and <span class="code ">node4@rabbit</span>.
