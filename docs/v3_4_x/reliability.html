    <div class="docSection"><a name="background-info" id="background-info"></a>
      <p class="intro">
        This page explains how to use the various features of AMQP
        and RabbitMQ to achieve <i>reliable delivery</i> - to ensure
        that messages are always delivered, even encountering
        failure in any part of your system.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="docSection"><a name="what-can-fail" id="what-can-fail"></a>
      <h2 class="docHeading">What Can Fail?</h2>
      <p>
        Network problems are probably the most common class of failure.  Not
        only can networks fail, firewalls can interrupt idle connections,
        and network failures are not always detected immediately.
      </p>
      <p>
        In addition to connectivity failures, the broker and client
        applications can experience hardware failure (or software can crash)
        at any time. Additionally, even if client applications keep running,
        logic errors can cause channel or connection errors which force the
        client to establish a new channel or connection and recover from the
        problem.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="docSection"><a name="connection-failures" id="connection-failures"></a>
      <h2 class="docHeading">Connection Failures</h2>
      <p>
        In the event of a connection failure, the client will need to
        establish a new connection to the broker.  Any channels opened on the
        previous connection will have been automatically closed and these will
        need re-opening too.
      </p>
      <p>
        In general when connections fail, the client will be informed by the
        connection throwing an exception (or similar language construct). The
        official Java and .NET clients additionally provide callback methods
        to let you hear about connection failures in other contexts - Java
        provides the <span class="code ">ShutdownListener</span> callback on
        both <span class="code ">Connection</span> and <span class="code ">Channel</span> classes, and
        .NET client provides <span class="code ">IConnection.ConnectionShutdown</span> and
        <span class="code ">IModel.ModelShutdown</span> events for the same purpose.
      </p>
      <h3>Acknowledgements and Confirms</h3>
      <p>
        When a connection fails, messages may be in transit between client and
        server - they may be in the middle of being parsed or generated, in OS
        buffers, or on the wire. Messages in transit will be lost - they will
        need to be retransmitted. <i>Acknowledgements</i> let the server and
        clients know when to do this.
      </p>
      <p>
        Acknowledgements can be used in both directions - to allow a consumer
        to indicate to the server that it has received / processed a message
        and to allow the server to indicate the same thing to the
        producer. RabbitMQ refers to the latter case as a "confirm".
      </p>
      <p>
        Of course, TCP ensures that packets have been received, and will
        retransmit until they are - but that's just the network
        layer. Acknowledgements and confirms indicate that messages have been
        received <i>and acted upon</i>. An acknowledgement signals both the
        receipt of a message, and a transfer of ownership where the receiver
        assumes full responsibility for it.
      </p>

      <p>
        Acknowledgements therefore have semantics - a consuming application
        should not acknowledge messages until it has done whatever it needs to
        do with them - recorded them in a database, forwarded them on, printed
        them onto paper or anything else. Once it does so, the broker is free
        to forget about the message.
      </p>

      <p>
        Similarly, the broker will confirm messages once it has taken
        responsibility for them (see <a href="confirms.html#when">here</a> for
        what that means).
      </p>

      <p>
        Use of acknowledgements guarantees <i>at-least-once</i>
        delivery. Without acknowledgements, message loss is possible
        during publish and consume operations and
        only <i>at-most-once</i> delivery is guaranteed.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="docSection"><a name="heartbeat-overview" id="heartbeat-overview"></a>
      <h2 class="docHeading">Detecting Dead TCP Connections with Heartbeats</h2>
      <p>
        In some types of network failure, packet loss can mean that
        disrupted TCP connections take a moderately long time (about 11
        minutes with default configuration on Linux, for example) to be
        detected by the operating system. AMQP 0-9-1 offers a
        <i>heartbeat</i> feature to ensure that the application layer
        promptly finds out about disrupted connections (and also
        completely unresponsive peers). Heartbeats also defend against
        certain network equipment which may terminate "idle" TCP
        connections. See <a href="heartbeats.html">Heartbeats</a> for details.
      </p>
</div>


    <div class="docSection"><a name="at-the-broker" id="at-the-broker"></a>
      <h2 class="docHeading">At the Broker</h2>
      <p>
        In order to avoid losing messages in the broker we need to cope with
        broker restarts, broker hardware failure and <i>in extremis</i> even
        broker crashes.
      </p>
      <p>
        To ensure that messages and broker definitions survive restarts, we
        need to ensure that they are on disk. The AMQP standard has a concept
        of durability for exchanges, queues and of persistent messages,
        requiring that a durable object or persistent message will survive a
        restart. More details about specific flags pertaining to durability
        and persistence can be found in the
        <a href="/v3_4_x/tutorials/amqp-concepts.html">AMQP Concepts Guide</a>.
      </p>
      <h3>Clustering and High Availability</h3>
      <p>
        If we need to ensure that our broker survives hardware failure, we can
        use RabbitMQ's clustering. In a RabbitMQ cluster, all definitions (of
        exchanges, bindings, users, etc) are mirrored across the entire
        cluster. Queues behave differently, by default residing only on a
        single node, but optionally being mirrored across several or all
        nodes. Queues remain visible and reachable from all nodes regardless
        of where they are located.
      </p>
      <p>
        Mirrored queues replicate their contents across all configured cluster
        nodes, tolerating node failures seamlessly and without message loss
        (although see <a href="ha.html#unsynchronised-slaves">this note on
        unsynchronised slaves</a>). However, consuming applications need to be
        aware that when queues fail their consumers will be cancelled and they
        will need to reconsume - see <a href="ha.html#behaviour">the
        documentation</a> for more details.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="docSection"><a name="producer" id="producer"></a>
      <h2 class="docHeading">At the Producer</h2>
      <p>
        When using confirms, producers recovering from a channel or connection
        failure should retransmit any messages for which an acknowledgement
        has not been received from the broker. There is a possibility of
        message duplication here, because the broker might have sent a
        confirmation that never reached the producer (due to network failures,
        etc). Therefore consumer applications will need to perform
        deduplication or handle incoming messages in an idempotent manner.
      </p>
      <h3>Ensuring Messages are Routed</h3>
      <p>
        In some circumstances it can be important for producers to ensure that
        their messages are being routed to queues (although not always - in
        the case of a pub-sub system producers will just publish and if no
        consumers are interested it is correct for messages to be dropped).
      </p>
      <p>
        To ensure messages are routed to a single known queue, the producer
        can just declare a destination queue and publish directly to it. If
        messages may be routed in more complex ways but the producer still
        needs to know if they reached at least one queue, it can set the
        <span class="code ">mandatory</span> flag on a <span class="code ">basic.publish</span>, ensuring
        that a <span class="code ">basic.return</span> (containing a reply code and some
        textual explanation) will be sent back to the client if no queues were
        appropriately bound.
      </p>
      <p>
        Producers should also be aware that when publishing to a clustered node,
        if one or more destination queues that are bound to the exchange have
        mirrors in the cluster, it's possible to incur delays in the face of
        network failures between nodes, due to flow control between replicas
        and the master queue process. See <a href="nettick.html">here</a> for
        more details.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="docSection"><a name="consumer" id="consumer"></a>
      <h2 class="docHeading">At the Consumer</h2>
      <p>
        In the event of network failure (or a node crashing), messages can be
        duplicated, and consumers must be prepared to handle them. If
        possible, the simplest way to handle this is to ensure that your
        consumers handle messages in an idempotent way rather than explicitly
        deal with deduplication.
      </p>
      <p>
        If a message is delivered to a consumer and then requeued (because it
        was not acknowledged before the consumer connection dropped, for
        example) then RabbitMQ will set the <span class="code ">redelivered</span> flag on
        it when it is delivered again (whether to the same consumer or a
        different one). This is a hint that a consumer <i>may</i> have seen
        this message before (although that's not guaranteed, the message may
        have made it out of the broker but not into a consumer before the
        connection dropped). Conversely if the <span class="code ">redelivered</span> flag
        is not set then it is guaranteed that the message has not been seen
        before. Therefore if a consumer finds it more expensive to deduplicate
        messages or process them in an idempotent manner, it can do this only
        for messages with the <span class="code ">redelivered</span> flag set.
      </p>
      <h3>Consumer Cancel Notification</h3>
      <p>
        Under some circumstances the server needs to be able to cancel a
        consumer - since the queue it was consuming from has been deleted, or
        has <a href="ha.html#behaviour">failed over</a>. In this case the
        consumer should consume again but be aware that it may see messages
        again which it has already seen.
      </p>
      <p>
        Note that consumer cancel notification is a RabbitMQ extension to
        AMQP, and as such may not be supported by all clients.
      </p>
      <h3>Messages That Cannot Be Processed</h3>
      <p>
        If a consumer determines that it cannot handle a message then it
        can <i>reject</i> it using <span class="code ">basic.reject</span>
        (or <span class="code ">basic.nack</span>), either asking the server to requeue it,
        or not (in which case the server might be configured
        to <a href="dlx.html">dead-letter</a> it instead.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="docSection"><a name="distribution" id="distribution"></a>
      <h2 class="docHeading">Distributed RabbitMQ</h2>
      <p>
        Rabbit provides two plugins to assist with distributing nodes over
        unreliable networks: <a href="federation.html">federation</a> and
        the <a href="shovel.html">shovel</a>. Both are implemented as AMQP
        clients, so if you configure them to use confirms and
        acknowledgements, they will retransmit when necessary. Both will use
        confirms and acknowledgements by default.
      </p>
      <p>
        When connecting clusters with federation or the shovel, it is
        desirable to ensure that the federation links and shovels tolerate
        node failures. Federation will automatically distribute links across
        the downstream cluster and fail them over on failure of a downstream
        node. In order to connect to a new upstream when an upstream
        node fails you can specify multiple redundant URIs for an upstream,
        or connect via a TCP load balancer.
      </p>
      <p>
        When using the shovel, it is possible to specify redundant brokers in
        a source or destination clause; however it is not currently possible
        to make the shovel itself redundant. We hope to improve this situation
        in the future; in the mean time a new node can be brought up manually
        to run a shovel if the node it was originally running on fails.
      </p>
