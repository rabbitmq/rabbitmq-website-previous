      <div class="docSection"><a name="overview" id="overview"></a>
        <p>
          By default, queues within a RabbitMQ cluster are located on
          a single node (the node on which they were first
          declared). This is in contrast to exchanges and bindings,
          which can always be considered to be on all nodes. Queues
          can optionally be made <i>mirrored</i> across multiple
          nodes. Each mirrored queue consists of one <i>master</i> and
          one or more <i>slaves</i>, with the oldest slave being
          promoted to the new master if the old master disappears for
          any reason.
        </p>
        <p>
          Messages published to the queue are replicated to all
          slaves. Consumers are connected to the master regardless of
          which node they connect to, with slaves dropping messages
          that have been acknowledged at the master. Queue mirroring
          therefore enhances availability, but does not distribute
          load across nodes (all participating nodes each do all the
          work).
        </p>
        <p>
          This solution requires a RabbitMQ cluster, which means that
          it will not cope seamlessly with network partitions within
          the cluster and, for that reason, is not recommended for use
          across a WAN (though of course, clients can still connect
          from as near and as far as needed).

        <h2 class="docHeading">Configuring Mirroring</h2>
        <p>
          Queues have mirroring enabled
          via <a href="parameters.html#policies">policy</a>. Policies
          can change at any time; it is valid to create a non-mirrored
          queue, and then make it mirrored at some later point (and
          vice versa). There is a difference between a non-mirrored
          queue and a mirrored queue which does not have any slaves -
          the former lacks the extra mirroring infrastructure and will
          run faster.
        </p>
        <p>
          You should be aware of the behaviour
          of <a href="#unsynchronised-slaves">adding mirrors to a
          queue</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          To cause queues to become mirrored, you should create a
          policy which matches them and sets policy
          keys <span class="code ">ha-mode</span> and
          (optionally) <span class="code ">ha-params</span>. The following table
          explains the options for these keys:
        </p>

        <table>
          <tr>
            <th><span class="code ">ha-mode</span></th>
            <th><span class="code ">ha-params</span></th>
            <th>Result</th>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td><span class="code ">all</span></td>
            <td>(absent)</td>
            <td>
              Queue is mirrored across all nodes in the
              cluster. When a new node is added to the cluster, the
              queue will be mirrored to that node.
            </td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td><span class="code ">exactly</span></td>
            <td><i>count</i></td>
            <td>
              Queue is mirrored to <i>count</i> nodes in the
              cluster. If there are less than <i>count</i> nodes in
              the cluster, the queue is mirrored to all nodes. If
              there are more than <i>count</i> nodes in the cluster,
              and a node containing a mirror goes down, then a new
              mirror will <b>not</b> be created on another node. (This
              is to prevent queues migrating across a cluster as it is
              brought down.)
            </td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td><span class="code ">nodes</span></td>
            <td><i>node names</i></td>
            <td>
              Queue is mirrored to the nodes listed in <i>node
              names</i>. If any of those node names are not a part of
              the cluster, this does not constitute an error. If none
              of the nodes in the list are online at the time when the
              queue is declared then the queue will be created on the
              node that the declaring client is connected to.
            </td>
          </tr>
        </table>

        <p>
          Whenever the HA policy for a queue changes it will endeavour
          to keep its existing mirrors as far as this fits with the new
          policy.
        </p>

        <h3>"nodes" policy and migrating masters</h3>

        <p>
          Note that setting or modifying a "nodes" policy can cause
          the existing master to go away if it is not listed in the
          new policy. In order to prevent message loss, RabbitMQ will
          keep the existing master around until at least one other
          slave has synchronised (even if this is a long
          time). However, once synchronisation has occured things will
          proceed just as if the node had failed: consumers will be
          disconnected from the master and will need to reconnect.
        </p>
        <p>
          For example, if a queue is on <span class="code ">[A B]</span>
          (with <span class="code ">A</span> the master), and you give it
          a <span class="code ">nodes</span> policy telling it to be on
          <span class="code ">[C D]</span>, it will initially end up on <span class="code ">[A C
          D]</span>. As soon as the queue synchronises on its new
          mirrors <span class="code ">[C D]</span>, the master on <span class="code ">A</span>
          will shut down.
        </p>

        <h3>Exclusive queues</h3>

        <p>
          Exclusive queues will be deleted when the connection that
          declared them is closed. For this reason, it is not useful
          for an exclusive queue to be mirrored (or durable for that
          matter) since when the node hosting it goes down, the
          connection will close and the queue will need to be deleted
          anyway.
        </p>

        <p>
          For this reason, exclusive queues are never mirrored (even
          if they match a policy stating that they should be). They
          are also never durable (even if declared as such).
        </p>

        <h3>Some examples</h3>

          "<span class="code ">ha.</span>" are mirrored to all nodes in the cluster:

        <h2 class="docHeading">Unsynchronised Slaves</h2>
        <p>
          A node may join a cluster at any time. Depending on the
          configuration of a queue, when a node joins a cluster,
          queues may add a slave on the new node. At this point, the
          new slave will be empty: it will not contain any existing
          contents of the queue. Such a slave will receive new
          messages published to the queue, and thus over time will
          accurately represent the tail of the mirrored queue. As
          messages are drained from the mirrored queue, the size of
          the head of the queue for which the new slave is missing
          messages, will shrink until eventually the slave's contents
          precisely match the master's contents. At this point, the
          slave can be considered fully synchronised, but it is
          important to note that this has occured because of actions
          of clients in terms of draining the pre-existing head of the
          queue.
        </p>
        <p>
          Thus a newly added slave provides no additional form of
          redundancy or availability of the queue's contents that
          existed before the slave was added, unless the queue has
          been explicitly synchronised. Since the queue becomes
          unresponsive while explicit synchronisation is occurring, it
          is preferable to allow active queues from which messages are
          being drained to synchronise naturally, and only explicitly
          synchronise inactive queues.
        </p>

        <h3 id="eager-synchronisation">Configuring explicit synchronisation</h3>

        <p>
          Explicit synchronisation can be triggered in two ways: manually or
          automatically. If a queue is set to automatically synchronise it
          will synchronise whenever a new slave joins - becoming unresponsive
          until it has done so.
        </p>

        <p>
          Queues can be set to automatically synchronise by setting
          the <span class="code ">ha-sync-mode</span> policy key
          to <span class="code ">automatic</span>. <span class="code ">ha-sync-mode</span> can also be set
          to <span class="code ">manual</span>. If it is not set then <span class="code ">manual</span> is
          assumed.
        </p>

        <p>
          You can determine which slaves are synchronised with the
          following rabbitmqctl invocation:
        </p>
        <pre class="sourcecode">rabbitmqctl list_queues name slave_pids synchronised_slave_pids</pre>
        <p>
          You can manually synchronise a queue with:
        </p>
        <pre class="sourcecode">rabbitmqctl sync_queue <i>name</i></pre>
        <p>
          And you can cancel synchronisation with:
        </p>
        <pre class="sourcecode">rabbitmqctl cancel_sync_queue <i>name</i></pre>
        <p>
          These features are also available through the management plugin.
        </p>

        <div class="docSubsection"><a name="start-stop" id="start-stop"></a>
          <h3 class="docHeading">Stopping nodes and synchronisation</h3>
          <p>
            If you stop a RabbitMQ node which contains the master of a
            mirrored queue, some slave on some other node will be
            promoted to the master (assuming there is one). If you
            continue to stop nodes then you will reach a point where a
            mirrored queue has no more slaves: it exists only on one
            node, which is now its master.  If the mirrored queue was
            declared <i>durable</i> then, if its last remaining node is
            shutdown, durable messages in the queue will survive the
            restart of that node. In general, as you restart other
            nodes, if they were previously part of a mirrored queue then
            they will rejoin the mirrored queue.
          </p>
          <p>
            However, there is currently no way for a slave to know
            whether or not its queue contents have diverged from the
            master to which it is rejoining (this could happen during a
            network partition, for example). As such, when a slave
            rejoins a mirrored queue, it throws away any durable local
            contents it already has and starts empty. Its behaviour is
            at this point the same as if it were a <a href="#unsynchronised-slaves">new node joining the
            cluster</a>.
          </p>
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="docSection"><a name="behaviour" id="behaviour"></a>
        <h2 class="docHeading">Mirrored queue implementation and semantics</h2>
        <p>
          As discussed, for each mirrored queue there is one
          <i>master</i> and several <i>slaves</i>, each on a
          different node. The slaves apply the operations that occur
          to the master in exactly the same order as the master and
          thus maintain the same state. All actions other than
          publishes go only to the master, and the master then
          broadcasts the effect of the actions to the slaves. Thus
          clients consuming from a mirrored queue are in fact
          consuming from the master.
        </p>
        <p>
          Should a slave fail, there is little to be done other than
          some bookkeeping: the master remains the master and no
          client need take any action or be informed of the failure.
          Note that slave failures may not be detected immediately and
          the interruption of the per-connection flow control mechanism
          can delay message publication. The details are described
          <a href="nettick.html">here</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          If the master fails, then one of the slaves must be
          promoted. At this point, the following happens:
          <ol>
            <li>A slave is promoted to become the new master. The
            slave chosen for promotion is the eldest slave. As such,
            it has the best chance of being synchronised with the
            master. However, note that should there be no slave that
            is <a href="#unsynchronised-slaves">synchronised</a> with
            the master, messages that only the master held will be
            lost.</li>

            <li>The slave considers all previous consumers to have
            been abruptly disconnected. As such, it requeues all
            messages that have been delivered to clients but are
            pending acknowledgement. This can include messages for
            which a client has issued acknowledgements: either the
            acknowledgement was lost on the wire before reaching the
            master, or it was lost during broadcast from the master to
            the slaves. In either case, the new master has no choice
            but to requeue all messages it thinks have not been

            <li>Clients that have requested it are cancelled (see <a href="#cancellation">below</a>).</li>

            <li><i>As a result of the requeuing, clients that
            re-consume from the queue <b>must</b> be aware that they
            are likely to subsequently receive messages that they have

          As the chosen slave becomes the master, no messages that are
          published to the mirrored queue during this time will be
          lost: messages published to a mirrored queue are always
          published directly to the master and all slaves. Thus should
          the master fail, the messages continue to be sent to the
          slaves and will be added to the queue once the promotion of
          a slave to the master completes.
        </p>
        <p>
          Similarly, messages published by clients using <a href="confirms.html">publisher confirms</a> will
          still be confirmed correctly even if the master (or any
          slaves) fail between the message being published and the
          message being able to be confirmed to the publisher. Thus
          from the point of view of the publisher, publishing to a
          mirrored queue is no different from publishing to any other
          sort of queue.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you are consuming from a mirrored queue with
          <i>noAck=true</i> (i.e. the client is not sending message
          acknowledgements) then messages can be lost. This is no
          different from the norm of course: the broker considers a
          message <i>acknowledged</i> as soon as it has been sent to a
          <i>noAck=true</i> consumer, and should the client disconnect
          abruptly, the message may never be received. In the case of
          a mirrored queue, should the master die, messages that are
          in-flight on their way to <i>noAck=true</i> consumers may
          never be received by those clients, and will not be requeued
          by the new master. Because of the possibility that the
          consuming client is connected to a node that survives, the
          <a href="#cancellation">Consumer
          Cancellation Notification</a> is useful in identifying when
          such events may have occurred. Of course, in practise, if
          you care about not losing messages then you are advised to
          consume with <i>noAck=false</i>.

          <p>
            Mirrored queues support both <a href="confirms.html">Publisher Confirms</a> and
            <a href="specification.html#tx">Transactions</a>. The
            semantics chosen are that in the case of both confirms and
            transactions, the action spans all mirrors of the
            queue. So in the case of a transaction, a
            <span class="code ">tx.commit-ok</span> will only be returned to a
            client when the transaction has been applied across all
            mirrors of the queue. Equally, in the case of publisher
            confirms, a message will only be confirmed to the
            publisher when it has been accepted by all of the
            mirrors. It is correct to think of the semantics as being
            the same as a message being routed to multiple normal
            queues, and of a transaction with publications within
            that similarly are routed to multiple queues.

            RabbitMQ uses a credit-based algorithm to <a href="memory.html#per-connection">limit the rate of
            message publication</a>.  Publishers are permitted to
            publish when they receive credit from all mirrors of a
            queue.  Credit in this context means permission to
            publish.  Slaves that fail to issue credit can cause
            publishers to stall.  Publishers will remain stalled until
            all slaves issue credit or until the remaining nodes
            consider the slave to be disconnected from the cluster.
            Erlang detects such disconnections by periodically sending
            a tick to all nodes. The tick interval can be controlled
            with the <a href="nettick.html">net_ticktime</a>
            configuration setting.

            Clients that are consuming from a mirrored queue may wish
            to know that the queue from which they have been consuming
            has failed over. When a mirrored queue fails over,
            knowledge of which messages have been sent to which
            consumer is lost, and therefore all unacknowledged
            messages are redelivered with the <span class="code ">redelivered</span>
            flag set. Consumers may wish to know this is going to
            happen.
          </p>
          <p>
            If so, they can consume with the argument
            <span class="code ">x-cancel-on-ha-failover</span> set to
            <span class="code ">true</span>. Their consuming will then be cancelled
            on failover and a <a href="consumer-cancel.html">consumer
            cancellation notification</a> sent. It is then the
            consumer's responsibility to reissue
            <span class="code ">basic.consume</span> to start consuming again.
          </p>
          <p>
            For example (in Java):
          </p>

          <pre class="sourcecode">
Channel channel = ...;
Consumer consumer = ...;
Map&lt;String, Object&gt; args = new HashMap&lt;String, Object&gt;();
args.put("x-cancel-on-ha-failover", true);
channel.basicConsume("my-queue", false, args, consumer);</pre>

          <p>
            This creates a new consumer with the argument set.
          </p>
