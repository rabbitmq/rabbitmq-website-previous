    <p>
      The high level goal of the federation plugin is to transmit messages
      between brokers without requiring clustering. This is useful for various
      reasons:
    </p>

    <dl class="plain">
      <dt><b>Loose coupling</b></dt>
      <dd>
        The federation plugin can transmit messages between brokers
        (or clusters) in different administrative domains:
        <ul class="plain">
          <li>
            they may have different users and virtual hosts;
          </li>
          <li>
            they may run on different versions of RabbitMQ and Erlang.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </dd>
      <dt><b>WAN-friendly</b></dt>
      <dd>
        The federation plugin uses AMQP to communicate between brokers, and is
        designed to tolerate intermittent connectivity.
      </dd>
      <dt><b>Specificity</b></dt>
      <dd>
        A broker can contain federated <i>and</i> local-only components - you
        don't need to federate everything if you don't want to.
      </dd>
      <dt><b>Scalability</b></dt>
      <dd>
        Federation does not require <i>n</i><sup>2</sup> connections between
        <i>n</i> brokers (although this is the easiest way to set
        things up), which should mean it scales better.
      </dd>
    </dl>

    <p>
      For the time being, federation is primarily useful in pub/sub scenarios.
    </p>

    <div class="docSection"><a name="what-does-it-do" id="what-does-it-do"></a>
      <h2 class="docHeading">What does it do?</h2>

      <p>
        The federation plugin allows you to make exchanges <i>federated</i>.
      </p>
      <dl>
        <dt>
          <b>What does a federated exchange do?</b>
        </dt>
        <dd>
          <p>
            A federated exchange links to other exchanges (called
            <i>upstream</i> exchanges). Logically (see next item), messages
            published to the upstream exchanges are copied to the federated
            exchange, as though they were published directly to it. The upstream
            exchanges do not need to be reconfigured and they do not have to be
            on the same broker or in the same cluster.
          </p>
          <p>
            Here is a diagram showing a single federated exchange in one
            broker linking to a set of two upstream exchanges in other
            brokers.
          </p>
          <img src="img/federation00.png" height="250" alt="Basic federated exchange" title="Basic federated exchange" />
          <p>
            All of the configuration needed to establish the upstream
            links and the federated exchange is in the broker with the
            federated exchange.
          </p>
        </dd>

        <dt>
          <b>Are <i>all</i> messages copied?</b>
        </dt>
        <dd>
          <p>
            Only those messages that need to be copied are propagated.
            This is an optimisation arranged dynamically by the federation
            plugin. (See <a href="#details">below</a>.)
          </p>
        </dd>

        <dt>
          <b>How does a federated exchange link to its upstream exchanges?</b>
        </dt>
        <dd>
          <p>
            The federated exchange will connect to all its upstream
            exchanges using AMQP. When declaring or configuring the
            federated exchange each upstream exchange is listed with
            the connection properties to be used to establish the
            link.
          </p>
        </dd>

        <dt>
          <b>Can I federate a federated exchange?</b>
        </dt>
        <dd>
          <p>
            There is nothing to prevent a federated exchange being 'upstream'
            from another federated exchange. One can even form 'loops', for
            example, exchange A declares exchange B to be upstream from it, and
            exchange B declares exchange A to be upstream from it. More complex
            multiply-connected arrangements are allowed.
          </p>
          <p>
            To prevent messages being continually copied and re-routed (in a
            never-ending cycle) there is a limit placed on the number of times a
            message can be copied over a link (see
            <a href="#upstream-sets"><span class="code ">max-hops</span></a> below). It is
            recommended that all the exchanges linked by federation are of the
            same type. Mixing types will lead to strange
            routing behaviour.
          </p>
        </dd>

        <dt>
          <b>Can I federate any exchange?</b>
        </dt>
        <dd>
          <p>
            Nearly. You can't federate the default exchange (named ''), since
            that is really just a way to directly address queues. You also
            can't federate exchanges that are marked as internal (since
            exchanges federate messages that are published directly to them,
            and you can't publish directly to an internal exchange).
          </p>
        </dd>

        <dt>
          <b>What are typical uses for federated exchanges?</b>
        </dt>
        <dd>
          <p>
            One typical use would be to have the same "logical" exchange
            distributed over many brokers. Each broker would declare a federated
            exchange with all the other federated exchanges upstream. (The links
            would form a complete bi-directional graph on <i>n</i> exchanges.)
          </p>
          <p>
            Another use would be to implement massive fanout - a single "root"
            exchange in one broker (which need not be federated) can be declared
            as upstream by many other federated exchanges in other brokers. In
            turn, each of these can be upstream for many more exchanges, and so
            on.
          </p>
          <p>
            See the <a href="#topology-diagrams">example diagrams
            below</a> for some possible arrangements.
          </p>
        </dd>
      </dl>

      <div class="docSubsection"><a name="details" id="details"></a>
        <h3 class="docHeading">Implementation</h3>
          <p>
            Inter-broker communication is implemented using AMQP (optionally
            secured with SSL). Bindings are grouped together and bind / unbind
            commands are sent to the upstream exchange. Therefore the federated
            exchange only receives messages for which it has a subscription. The
            bindings are sent upstream asynchronously - so the effect of adding
            or removing a binding is only guaranteed to be seen eventually.
          </p>
          <p>
            The messages are buffered in a queue created in the upstream
            exchange's broker. This is called the <i>upstream queue</i>.
            It is the upstream queue which is bound to the upstream
            exchange with the grouped bindings. It is possible to tailor
            some of the properties of this queue in the <a href="#upstreams">upstream configuration</a>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Here is a detailed diagram showing a single federated
            exchange linking to a single upstream exchange including the
            upstream queue and bindings created by the federation plugin
            shown in grey. The fat arrow on the upstream link indicates
            messages republished by the federated exchange. Some
            potential publisher clients are shown publishing to both
            exchanges.
          </p>
          <img src="img/federation01.png" height="180" alt="Simple federation" title="Simple federation" />
          <p>
            Publications to either exchange may be received by queues bound to
            the federated exchange, but publications directly to the federated
            exchange cannot be received by queues bound to the upstream
            exchange.
          </p>
      </div>

    </div>

    <div class="docSection"><a name="getting-started" id="getting-started"></a>
      <h2 class="docHeading">Getting Started</h2>

      <p>
        The federation plugin is included in the RabbitMQ distribution. To
        enable it, use
        <a href="man/rabbitmq-plugins.1.man.html">rabbitmq-plugins</a>:
      </p>
      <pre class="example">rabbitmq-plugins enable rabbitmq_federation</pre>

      <p>
        When using the management plugin, you will also want to
        enable <span class="code ">rabbitmq_federation_management</span>:
      </p>
      <pre class="example">rabbitmq-plugins enable rabbitmq_federation_management</pre>

      <p>
        When using a federation in a cluster, all the nodes of the
        cluster must have the federation plugin installed. Any node
        can declare a federated exchange and its properties are shared
        in the cluster as usual. If a node fails, links to upstream
        exchanges will be recreated on a surviving node.
      </p>

      <p>
        Information about federation is stored in the RabbitMQ
        database, along with users, permissions, queues, etc. There
        are three levels of configuration involved in federation:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>Upstreams</b> - each upstream defines how to connect
          to another broker.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Upstream sets</b> - each upstream set groups together a
          set of upstreams for exchanges to use for federation.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Policies</b> - each policy selects a set of exchanges,
          and applies an upstream set to those exchanges.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        In practice for simple use cases you can almost ignore the
        existence of upstream sets, since there is an
        implicitly-defined upstream set called <span class="code ">all</span> to
        which all upstreams are added.
      </p>

      <p>
        Upstreams and upstream sets are both instances of <i>parameters</i>.
        Like exchanges and queues, each virtual host has its own distinct
        set of parameters and policies. For more generic information on
        parameters and policies, <a href="parameters.html">see the
        documentation</a>.
      </p>

      <p>
        Parameters and policies can be set in three ways - either with
        an invocation of <span class="code ">rabbitmqctl</span>, a call to the
        management HTTP API, or (usually) through the web UI presented
        by <span class="code ">rabbitmq_federation_management</span>. (The web UI
        does not present all possibilities - in particular, it does
        not allow you to manage upstream sets.)
      </p>

      <div class="docSubsection"><a name="tutorial" id="tutorial"></a>
        <h3 class="docHeading">A simple example</h3>

        <p>
          Here we will federate all the built-in exchanges except for
          the default exchange, with a single upstream. The upstream
          will be defined to buffer messages when disconnected for up
          to one hour (3600000ms).
        </p>

        <p><b>Define an upstream:</b></p>

        <tr>
          <th>Web UI</th>
          <td>
            Navigate to Admin &gt; Policies &gt; Add / update a
            policy. Enter "federate-me" next to Name, "^amq\." next to
            Regexp and "federation-upstream-set" = "all"
            in the first line next to Policy. Click Add policy.
          </td>
        </tr>
        </table>

        <p>
          We tell the policy to federate all exchanges whose names
          begin with "amq." (i.e. all the built in exchanges except
          for the default exchange) with (implicit) low priority, and
          to federate them using the implicitly created upstream set
          "all", which includes our newly-created upstream.  Any other
          matching policy with a priority greater than 0 will take
          precedence over this policy.
        </p>

        <p>
          The built in exchanges should now be federated. You can
          check that the policy has applied to the exchanges by
          checking the exchanges list in management or with:
        </p>
        <pre class="code">rabbitmqctl list_exchanges name policy | grep federate-me</pre>
        <p>
          And you can check that federation links for each exchange have come up with Admin &gt; Federation Status &gt; Running Links or with:
        </p>
        <pre class="code">rabbitmqctl eval 'rabbit_federation_status:status().'</pre>
        <p>
          In general there will be one federation link for each
          upstream that is applied to an exchange. So for example with
          three exchanges and two upstreams for each there will be six
          links.
        </p>

        <p>
          For simple use this should be all you need - you will probably want to look at the <a href="uri-spec.html">AMQP URI reference</a>.

            The maximum number of federation links that a message can

              The expiry time (in milliseconds) after which an <a href="#details"><i>upstream queue</i></a> may be deleted,
              if a connection to the upstream broker is lost. The default is
              <span class="code ">'none'</span>, meaning the queue should never

            </p>
            <p>
              This setting controls how long the upstream queue will

              The expiry time for messages in the <i>upstream queue</i> (see

              Determines how the link should acknowledge messages. If set

              acknowledged to the upstream broker after they have been
              confirmed downstream. This handles network errors and broker
              failures without losing messages, and is the slowest option.
            </p>
            <p>
              If set to <span class="code ">on-publish</span>, messages are acknowledged to
              the upstream broker after they have been published
              downstream. This handles network errors without losing messages,
              but may lose messages in the event of broker failures.
            </p>
            <p>
              If set to <span class="code ">no-ack</span>, message acknowledgements are not
              used. This is the fastest option, but may lose messages in the
              event of network or broker failures.
            </p>

              federation will pass through any validated user-id from
              the upstream, even though it cannot validate it
              itself. If set to <span class="code ">false</span> or not set, it will
              clear any validated user-id it encounters. You should
              only set this to <span class="code ">true</span> if you trust the
              upstream server (and by extension, all its upstreams)
              not to forge user-ids.

            only of interest when connecting to old brokers which
            determine queue HA mode using this argument. Default
            is <span class="code ">'none'</span>, meaning the queue is not HA.

      <div class="docSubsection"><a name="upstream-sets" id="upstream-sets"></a>
        <h3 class="docHeading">Upstream sets</h3>
        <p>
          Each <span class="code ">upstream-set</span> list is a mapping from
          a name to a list of upstream exchanges. They look like:
        </p>
<pre class="example">rabbitmqctl set_parameter federation-upstream-set <i>name</i> '[<i>json-object</i>, <i>json-object</i>, ...]'
</pre>
        <p>
          The keys of the JSON objects can be:
        </p>

        <dl>
          <dt><span class="code ">upstream</span></dt>
          <dd>
            The name of an upstream. Mandatory.
          </dd>

          <dt><span class="code ">exchange</span></dt>
          <dd>
            The name of the upstream exchange. Default is to use the same name
            as the federated exchange.
          </dd>
        </dl>

        <p>
          In addition, any of the properties from an upstream can be
          overridden in an upstream set.
        </p>

        <p>
          There is an implicitly-defined upstream
          set, <span class="code ">all</span>, which contains all upstreams.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="docSubsection"><a name="other-config" id="other-config"></a>
        <h3 class="docHeading">local-username</h3>
        <p>
          The <span class="code ">local-username</span> parameter specifies the user
          under which to publish messages to the (local) federated
          exchanges. The default is
          <span class="code ">"guest"</span>. This user will need the appropriate permissions
          to publish messages to these exchanges. Example:
        </p>

        <pre class="example">rabbitmqctl set_parameter federation local-username '"guest"'</pre>

        <h3 class="docHeading">local-nodename</h3>
        <p>
          The <span class="code ">local-nodename</span> parameter specifies the name
          this node should use to identify itself to other nodes in
          the federation graph. (The default is constructed from the
          Erlang node and the machine's fully-qualified domain name.)
        </p>
        <p>
          It is important to specify it explicitly if your DNS will
          not give machines distinct names.
        </p>
        <p>
          Example:
        </p>

        <pre class="example">rabbitmqctl set_parameter federation local-nodename '"my-node"'</pre>

      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="docSection"><a name="topology-diagrams" id="topology-diagrams"></a>
      <h2 class="docHeading">Example topologies</h2>
      <p>
        We illustrate some example federation topologies. Where RabbitMQ
        brokers are shown in these diagrams (indicated by a <img src="img/rabbitmq_logo_30x30.png" height="15" />) it is possible
        to have a cluster of brokers instead.
      </p>
      <dl>
        <dt><b>Pair of federated exchanges</b></dt>
        <dd>
          <p>
            Each exchange links to the other in this symmetric arrangement. A
            publisher and consumer connected to each broker are illustrated.
            Both consumers can receive messages published by either publisher.
          </p>
          <img src="img/federation02.png" height="215" alt="Symmetric pair" title="Symmetric pair" />
          <p>
            Both links are declared with <span class="code ">max-hops=1</span> so that
            messages are copied only once, otherwise the consumers will see
            multiple copies of the same message (up to the <span class="code ">max-hops</span>
            limit).
          </p>
        </dd>

        <dt><b>Small complete graph</b></dt>
        <dd>
          <p>
            This arrangement is the analogue of the pair of federated exchanges
            but for three exchanges. Each exchange links to both the others.
          </p>
          <img src="img/federation03.png" height="250" alt="Three-way federation" title="Three-way federation" />
          <p>
            Again <span class="code ">max-hops=1</span> because the "hop distance" to any
            other exchange is exactly one. This will be the case in any complete
            graph of federated exchanges.
          </p>
        </dd>

        <dt><b>Fan-out</b></dt>
        <dd>
          <p>
            One master exchange (which it is <i>not</i> necessary to federate)
            is linked to by a tree of exchanges, which can extend to any depth.
            In this case messages published to the master exchange can be
            received by any consumer connected to any broker in the tree.
          </p>
          <img src="img/federation04.png" height="500" alt="Fan-out" title="Fan-out" />
          <p>
            Because there are no loops it is not as crucial to get the
            <span class="code ">max-hops</span> value right, but it must be at least
            as large as the longest connecting path. For a tree this is
            the number of levels minus one.
          </p>
        </dd>

        <dt><b>Ring</b></dt>
        <dd>
          <p>
            In this ring of six brokers each federated exchange links to just
            one other in the ring. The <span class="code ">"max-hops"</span> property is set
            to 5 so that every exchange in the ring sees the message exactly
            once.
          </p>
          <img src="img/federation05.png" height="300" alt="Ring" title="Ring" />
          <p>
            This topology, though relatively cheap in queues and connections, is
            rather fragile compared to a completely connected graph. One broker
            (or connection) failure breaks the ring.
          </p>
        </dd>

      </dl>
    </div>
    <div class="docSection"><a name="status" id="status"></a>
      <h2 class="docHeading">Link Status Reporting</h2>
      <p>
        Each combination of federated exchange and upstream needs a link to
        run. This is the process that retrieves messages from upstream and
        republishes them downstream. You can monitor the status of federation
        links using <span class="code ">rabbitmqctl</span> and the management plugin.
      </p>
      <h3>Using rabbitmqctl</h3>
      <p>Invoke:</p>

      <pre class="example">rabbitmqctl eval 'rabbit_federation_status:status().'</pre>

      <p>
        This will return a list of federation links running on the node you
        are connecting to (i.e. not cluster-wide). It contains the following
        keys:
      </p>

      <dl>
        <dt><span class="code ">exchange</span></dt>
        <dd>
          the name of the federated exchange
        </dd>
        <dt><span class="code ">upstream_exchange</span></dt>
        <dd>
          the name of the upstream exchange
        </dd>
        <dt><span class="code ">vhost</span></dt>
        <dd>
          the virtual host containing the federated exchange
        </dd>
        <dt><span class="code ">connection</span></dt>
        <dd>
          the name of the connection for this link (from config)
        </dd>
        <dt><span class="code ">status</span></dt>
        <dd>
          status of the link:
          <ul>
            <li><span class="code ">starting</span></li>
            <li><span class="code ">{running, LocalConnectionName}</span></li>
            <li><span class="code ">{shutdown, Error}</span></li>
          </ul>
        </dd>
        <dt><span class="code ">timestamp</span></dt>
        <dd>
          time the status was last updated
        </dd>
      </dl>
      <p>Example:</p>

      <pre class="example"># rabbitmqctl eval 'rabbit_federation_status:status().'
[[{exchange,&lt;&lt;"my-exchange"&gt;&gt;},
  {vhost,&lt;&lt;"/"&gt;&gt;},
  {connection,&lt;&lt;"upstream-server"&gt;&gt;},
  {upstream_exchange,&lt;&lt;"my-upstream-x"&gt;&gt;},
  {status,{running,&lt;&lt;"&lt;rabbit@my-server.1.281.0&gt;"&gt;&gt;}},
  {timestamp,{{2012,3,1},{12,3,28}}}]]
...done.</pre>

      <h3>Using the management plugin</h3>

      <p>
        Install the <span class="code ">rabbitmq_federation_management</span> plugin. You
        will now be able to see all federation links in the cluster by
        clicking on Admin &gt; Federation Status, or making an HTTP request to
        <span class="code ">GET /api/federation-links</span>.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="docSection"><a name="clustering" id="clustering"></a>
      <h2 class="docHeading">Federating clusters</h2>
      <p>
        Clusters can be linked together with federation just as single brokers
        can. To summarise how clustering and federation interact:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          You can define policies and parameters on any node in the downstream
          cluster; once defined on one node they will apply on all nodes.
        </li>
        <li>
          Federation links will start on any node in the downstream
          cluster. They will fail over to other nodes if the node they are
          running on crashes or stops.
        </li>
        <li>
          To connect to an upstream cluster, you can specify multiple URIs in
          a single upstream. The federation link process will choose one of
          these URIs at random each time it attempts to connect.
        </li>
