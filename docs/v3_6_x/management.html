        <h2 class="docHeading">Introduction</h2>
        <p>
          The rabbitmq-management plugin provides an HTTP-based API
          for management and monitoring of your RabbitMQ server, along
          with a browser-based UI and a command line tool, <a href="management-cli.html">rabbitmqadmin</a>. Features
          include:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Declare, list and delete exchanges, queues, bindings,
            users, virtual hosts and permissions.
          </li>
          <li>
            Monitor queue length, message rates globally and per
            channel, data rates per connection, etc.
          </li>
          <li>
            Monitor resource usage, such as file descriptors, memory
            use, available disk space.
          </li>
          <li>
            Manage users (provided administrative permissions of the current user).
          </li>
          <li>
            Export and import object definitions (vhosts, users,
            permissions, queues, exchanges, bindings, parameters,
            policies) to JSON.
          </li>
          <li>
            Force close connections, purge queues.
          </li>
          <li>
            Send and receive messages (useful in development environments
            and for troubleshooting).
          </li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <div class="docSection"><a name="getting-started" id="getting-started"></a>
        <h2 class="docHeading">Getting started</h2>

        <p>
          The management plugin is included in the RabbitMQ
          distribution. To enable it, use <a href="man/rabbitmq-plugins.1.man.html">rabbitmq-plugins</a>:
        </p>
        <pre class="sourcecode bash">rabbitmq-plugins enable rabbitmq_management</pre>
        <ul>
          <li>
            The Web UI is located at:
            http://<i>server-name</i>:15672/
          </li>
          <li>
            The Web UI uses an HTTP API provided by the same plugin. Said API's documentation can be accessed at
            http://<i>server-host</i>:15672/api/ or
            our <a href="https://rawcdn.githack.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-management/rabbitmq_v3_6_14/priv/www/api/index.html">
            latest HTTP API documentation here</a>).
          </li>
          <li>
            Download <a href="management-cli.html">rabbitmqadmin</a>
            at: http://<i>server-name</i>:15672/cli/
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          NB: The port for RabbitMQ versions prior to 3.0 is 55672.
        </p>
        <p>
          To use the web UI you will need to authenticate as a
          RabbitMQ user (on a fresh installation the user "guest" is
          created with password "guest"). From here you can manage
          exchanges, queues, bindings, virtual hosts, users and
          permissions. Hopefully the UI is fairly self-explanatory.
        </p>
        <p>
          The management UI is implemented as a single static HTML
          page which makes background queries to the HTTP API. As such
          it makes heavy use of Javascript. It has been tested with
          recent versions of Firefox, Chromium and Safari, and with
          versions of Microsoft Internet Explorer back to 6.0.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="docSection"><a name="permissions" id="permissions"></a>
        <h2 class="docHeading">Permissions</h2>
        <p>
          The management plugin extends the existing <a href="access-control.html">permissions model</a> somewhat. Users can
          be given arbitrary tags within RabbitMQ. The management plugin makes
          use of tags called "management", "policymaker", "monitoring" and
          "administrator". The following table shows what the different types
          of user can do:
        </p>
        <table>
          <tr>
            <th>Tag</th>
            <th>Capabilities</th>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>(None)</td>
            <td>
              No access to the management plugin
            </td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>management</td>
            <td>
              Anything the user could do via AMQP plus:
              <ul>
                <li>List virtual hosts to which they can log in via AMQP</li>
                <li>
                  View all queues, exchanges and bindings in "their"
                  virtual hosts
                </li>
                <li>View and close their own channels and connections</li>
                <li>
                  View "global" statistics covering all their
                  virtual hosts, including activity by other users
                  within them
                </li>
              </ul>
            </td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>policymaker</td>
            <td>
              Everything "management" can plus:
              <ul>
                <li>
                  View, create and delete policies and parameters for virtual
                  hosts to which they can log in via AMQP
                </li>
              </ul>
            </td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>monitoring</td>
            <td>
              Everything "management" can plus:
              <ul>
                <li>
                  List all virtual hosts, including ones they could
                  not log in to via AMQP
                </li>
                <li>View other users's connections and channels</li>
                <li>View node-level data such as memory use and clustering</li>
                <li>View truly global statistics for all virtual hosts</li>
              </ul>
            </td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>administrator</td>
            <td>
              Everything "policymaker" and "monitoring" can plus:
              <ul>
                <li>Create and delete virtual hosts</li>
                <li>View, create and delete users</li>
                <li>View, create and delete permissions</li>
                <li>Close other users's connections</li>
              </ul>
            </td>
          </tr>
        </table>
        <p>
          Note that since "administrator" does everything "monitoring"
          does, and "monitoring" does everything "management" does,
          you frequently only need to give each user a maximum of one tag.
        </p>
        <p>
          Normal RabbitMQ permissions still apply to monitors and
          administrators; just because a user is a monitor or
          administrator does not give them full access to exchanges,
          queues and bindings through either AMQP or the management
          plugin.
        </p>
        <p>
          All users can only list objects within a particular virtual
          host if they have any permissions for that virtual host.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you get locked out due to only having non-administrator
          users, or no users at all, you can use <a href="/man/rabbitmqctl.1.man.html#">rabbitmqctl add_user</a>
          to create a non-administrator user and <a href="/man/rabbitmqctl.1.man.html#set_user_tags">rabbitmqctl
          set_user_tags</a> to promote a user to administrator.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="docSection"><a name="http-api" id="http-api"></a>
        <h2 class="docHeading">HTTP API</h2>
        <p>
          The management plugin will create an HTTP-based API at
          http://<i>server-name</i>:15672/api/. Browse to that
          location for more information on the API.
          For convenience you can read the
          <a href="https://cdn.rawgit.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-management/rabbitmq_v3_6_14/priv/www/api/index.html">
          latest HTTP API documentation</a> on GitHub.
        </p>

        <p>
          The API is intended to be used for monitoring and alerting purposes. It provides
          access to detailed information about the state of nodes, connections, channels, queues,
          consumers, and so on.
        </p>

        <p>
          HTTP API can be used on any node that has the <span class="code ">rabbitmq-management</span> plugin
          enabled. It then will be able to provide metrics on any (or all) cluster node.
          When monitoring a cluster of nodes, there is no need to contact each node via HTTP API
          individually. Instead, contact a random node or a load balancer that sits in front
          of the cluster.
        </p>

        <p>
          For HTTP API clients in several languages,
          see <a href="/devtools.html">Developer Tools</a>.
        </p>

        <p>
          Some API endpoints return a lot of information. The volume can be reduced
          by filtering what columns are returned by `HTTP GET` requests. See
          <a href="https://cdn.rawgit.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-management/rabbitmq_v3_6_14/priv/www/api/index.html">
          latest HTTP API documentation</a> for details.
        </p>

        <p>
          <a href="management-cli.html">rabbitmqadmin</a> is a Python command  line tool
          that interacts with the HTTP API. It can be downloaded from any RabbitMQ node that
          has the management plugin enabled, see http://<i>server-name</i>:15672/cli/
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="docSection"><a name="configuration" id="configuration"></a>
        <h2 class="docHeading">Configuration</h2>
        <p>
          There are several configuration options which affect the
          management plugin. These are managed through the main
          RabbitMQ
          <a href="configure.html#configuration-file">configuration file</a>.
        </p>
        <div class="docSubsection"><a name="load-definitions" id="load-definitions"></a>
          <h3 class="docHeading">Load definitions at startup</h3>
          <p>
            The management plugin lets you export a JSON file
            containing definitions of all broker objects (queues,
            exchanges, bindings, users, virtual hosts, permissions and
            parameters). In some scenarios it may be useful to ensure
            the existence of these objects at every startup.
          </p>
          <p>
            To do this, set the <span class="code ">rabbitmq_management.load_definitions</span> config key
            to the path of a previously exported JSON file containing
            the definitions you want:

          <pre class="sourcecode erlang">[
{rabbitmq_management, [
  {load_definitions, "/path/to/definitions/file.json"}
  ]}
].</pre>
          </p>
          <p>
            Note that the definitions in the file will overwrite
            anything already in the broker; using this option will not
            delete anything that is already there. However, if you
            start from a completely reset broker, use of this
            option <b>will</b> prevent the usual default user /
            virtual host / permissions from being created.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="docSubsection"><a name="fine-stats" id="fine-stats"></a>
          <h3 class="docHeading">Message rates</h3>
          <p>
            The management plugin by default shows message rates
            globally, and for each queue, channel, exchange, and
            vhost. These are known as the <i>basic</i> message rates.
          </p>
          <p>
            It can also show message rates for all the combinations of
            channel to exchange, exchange to queue, and queue to
            channel. These are known as <i>detailed</i> message rates.
            Detailed message rates are disabled by default as they can
            have a large memory footprint when there are a large
            number of combinations of channels, queues and exchanges.
          </p>
          <p>
            Alternatively, the message rates can be disabled
            altogether. This can help get the best possible
            performance out of a CPU-bound server.
          </p>
          <p>
            The message rate mode is controlled by the
            <span class="code ">rates_mode</span> configuration variable in
            <span class="code ">rabbitmq_management</span>. This can be one of
            <span class="code ">basic</span> (the default), <span class="code ">detailed</span> or
            <span class="code ">none</span>.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="docSubsection"><a name="statistics-interval" id="statistics-interval"></a>
          <h3 class="docHeading">Statistics interval</h3>
          <p>
            By default the server will emit statistics events every
            5000ms. The message rate values shown in the management
            plugin are calculated over this period. You may therefore
            want to increase this value in order to sample rates over
            a longer period, or to reduce the statistics load on a
            server with a very large number of queues or channels.
          </p>
          <p>
            In order to do so, set the value of
            the <span class="code ">collect_statistics_interval</span> variable for
            the <span class="code ">rabbit</span> application to the desired
            interval in milliseconds and restart RabbitMQ.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="docSubsection"><a name="http-logging" id="http-logging"></a>
          <h3 class="docHeading">HTTP request logging</h3>
          <p>
            To create simple access logs of requests to the HTTP API,
            set the value of the <span class="code ">http_log_dir</span> variable in
            the <span class="code ">rabbitmq_management</span> application to the name
            of a directory in which logs can be created and restart
            RabbitMQ. Note that only requests to the API
            at <span class="code ">/api</span> are logged, not requests to the static
            files which make up the browser-based GUI.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="docSubsection"><a name="max-backlog" id="max-backlog"></a>
          <h3 class="docHeading">Events backlog</h3>
          <p>
            Under heavy load, the processing of statistics events can
            increase the memory consumption. To reduce this,
            the maximum backlog size of the channel and queue statistics
            collectors can be regulated. The value of the
            <span class="code ">stats_event_max_backlog</span> variable in
            the <span class="code ">rabbitmq_management</span> application sets
            the maximum size of both backlogs. Defaults to 250.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="docSubsection"><a name="web-dispatch-config" id="web-dispatch-config"></a>
          <h3 class="docHeading">Configuring the HTTP listener</h3>
          <p>
            It is possible to configure rabbitmq-web-dispatch to serve the
            management plugin on a different port or network
            interface, with SSL, etc. To do so, you should configure the
            <span class="code ">listener</span> configuration item; for example to
            change the port:
          </p>
          <pre class="sourcecode erlang">[
  ...
  {rabbitmq_management, [{listener, [{port, 12345}]}]},
  ...
].</pre>

          <p>
            or to make the management plugin use HTTPS:
          </p>
          <pre class="sourcecode erlang">
[{rabbitmq_management,
  [{listener, [{port,     15671},
               {ssl,      true},

          <p>
            The management plugin will retain samples of some data
            such as message rates and queue lengths. You can
            configure how long such data is retained.

            then at a 1 minute resolution for 1 hour and 1 minute, then at a 10 minute
            resolution for about 8 hours. It retains basic data at a 5 second
            resolution for 1 minute and 5 seconds, then at a 1 minute resolution for
            1 hour, and detailed data only for 10 seconds. All three policies are mandatory, and must contain

        <h2 class="docHeading">Memory Use Analysis</h2>
        <p>
          Management UI can be used to inspect node's memory use, including displaying
          a per-category breakdown. See the <a href="/memory-use.html">Memory Use Analysis</a> guide
          for details.

      <div class="docSection"><a name="clustering" id="clustering"></a>
        <h2 class="docHeading">Note on clustering</h2>
        <p>
          The management plugin is aware of clusters. You can enable
          it on one or more nodes in a cluster, and see information
          pertaining to the entire cluster no matter which node you
          connect to.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you want to deploy cluster nodes which do not have the
          full management plugin enabled, you will still need to
          enable the <span class="code ">rabbitmq-management-agent</span> plugin on
          each node.
        </p>
        <p>
          When clustered the management plugin performs cluster-wide queries
          which means it can be affected by various network events such as
          <a href="nettick.html">partitions</a>.

        <p>
          It is possible to make the web UI available via any proxy that
          conforms with RFC 1738. The following sample Apache configuration
          illustrates the minimum necessary directives to coax Apache into
          conformance. It assumes a management web UI on the default port of 15672:

      <div class="docSection"><a name="stats-db" id="stats-db"></a>
        <h2 class="docHeading">Restarting Statistics Database</h2>

        <p>
          Statistics database is stored entirely in memory. All of its contents
          is transient and should be treated as such.

          Prior to version 3.6.7 stats database is stored on a single node.

          Starting from version 3.6.7, each node has its own statistics database
          containing a fraction of stats recorded on this node.

          It is possible to restart the stats database.
        </p>
        <p>
          The statistics database is stored in the memory of the stats process
          previously to RabbitMQ 3.6.2, and stored in ETS tables from RabbitMQ
          3.6.2. To restart the database with versions earlier than 3.6.2, use

<pre class="sourcecode bash">
rabbitmqctl eval 'exit(erlang:whereis(rabbit_mgmt_db), please_terminate).'
</pre>

Starting with RabbitMQ 3.6.2 and up to 3.6.5, use
<pre class="sourcecode bash">
rabbitmqctl eval 'supervisor2:terminate_child(rabbit_mgmt_sup_sup, rabbit_mgmt_sup),
                  rabbit_mgmt_sup_sup:start_child().'
</pre>
          These commands must be executed on the node hosting the database.

Starting with RabbitMQ 3.6.7, the database can be reset per node using
<pre class="sourcecode bash">
rabbitmqctl eval 'rabbit_mgmt_storage:reset().'
</pre>

To reset entire management database on all nodes
<pre class="sourcecode bash">
rabbitmqctl eval 'rabbit_mgmt_storage:reset_all().'
</pre>

There is also HTTP API endpoints to reset a database
For entire database
<pre class="sourcecode">
DELETE /api/reset
</pre>

For a single node
<pre class="sourcecode">
DELETE /api/reset/:node
</pre>

      <div class="docSection"><a name="memory-mgmt" id="memory-mgmt"></a>
        <h2 class="docHeading">Memory Management</h2>
        <div>
          The memory usage of the management database can be obtained with <i>rabbitmqctl</i>:
<pre class="sourcecode bash">
rabbitmqctl status
</pre>
          or a GET request to /api/nodes/<i>name</i> via the <a href="https://cdn.rawgit.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-management/rabbitmq_v3_6_14/priv/www/api/index.html">
          HTTP API</a>.

          <p>
          Stats are emitted periodically, regulated by the statistics
          interval described above, or when certain components are
          created/declared (e.g. a new connection or channel is
          opened, or a queue declared) or closed/deleted.  Message
          rates do not directly affect management database memory
          usage.
          </p>
          <p>
          Total amount of memory consumed by the stats database
          depends on the event emission interval, effective rates mode and
          retention policies.
          </p>
          <p>
          Increasing the <span class="code ">rabbit.collect_statistics_interval</span> value to 30-60s (note: the value should
          be set in milliseconds, e.g. <span class="code ">30000</span>) will reduce memory
          comsuption for systems with large amounts of queues/channels/connections.
          Adjusting retention policies to retain less data will also help.
          </p>
          <p>
          The memory usage of the channel and stats collector processes can be limited
          by setting the maximum backlog queue size using the parameter
          <span class="code ">stats_event_max_backlog</span>. If the backlog queue is full, new channel
          and queue stats will be dropped until the previous ones have been processed.
          </p>
          <p>
          The statistics interval can also be changed at runtime. Doing so will have no
          effect on existing connections, channels or queues. Only new stats
          emitting entities are affected.
<pre class="sourcecode bash">
rabbitmqctl eval 'application:set_env(rabbit, collect_statistics_interval, 60000).'
</pre>
          </p>
          The statistics database can be restarted (see above) and thus forced to release all memory.
