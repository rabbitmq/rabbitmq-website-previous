    <p>
      When a channel is consuming from a queue, there are various
      reasons which could cause the consumption to stop. One of
      these is obviously if the client issues a
      <span class="code ">basic.cancel</span> on the same channel, which will
      cause the consumer to be cancelled and the server replies
      with a <span class="code ">basic.cancel-ok</span>. Other events, such as
      the queue being deleted, or in a clustered scenario, the
      node on which the queue is located failing, will cause the
      consumption to be cancelled, but the client channel will not
      be informed, which is frequently unhelpful.
    </p>

    <p>
      To solve this, we have introduced an extension in which the
      broker will send to the client a <span class="code ">basic.cancel</span>
      in the case of such unexpected consumer cancellations. This
      is not sent in the case of the broker receiving a
      <span class="code ">basic.cancel</span> from the client. AMQP 0-9-1
      clients don't by default expect to receive
      <span class="code ">basic.cancel</span> methods from the broker
      asynchronously, and so in order to enable this behaviour,
      the client must present a <span class="code ">capabilities</span> table in
      its <span class="code ">client-properties</span> in which there is a key
      <span class="code ">consumer_cancel_notify</span> and a boolean value
      <span class="code ">true</span>. See the
      <a href="#capabilities">capabilities</a> section for further
      details on this.
    </p>

    <p>
      Our supported clients present this capability by default to
      the broker and thus will be sent the asynchronous
      <span class="code ">basic.cancel</span> method by the broker, which they
      present to the consumer callback. For example, in our Java
      client, the <span class="code ">Consumer</span> interface has a
      <span class="code ">handleCancel</span> callback, which can be overridden
      by sub-classing the <span class="code ">QueueingConsumer</span> class:
      <pre class="sourcecode">
channel.queueDeclare(queue, false, true, false, null);
Consumer consumer = new QueueingConsumer(channel) {
    @Override
    public void handleCancel(String consumerTag) throws IOException {
        // consumer has been cancelled unexpectedly
    }
};
channel.basicConsume(queue, consumer);</pre>
      It is not an error for the client to issue a
      <span class="code ">basic.cancel</span> for a consumer which has been
      unexpectedly cancelled (e.g. due to queue deletion). By
      definition, there is a race possible between a client
      issuing a <span class="code ">basic.cancel</span>, and the broker sending
      out the asynchronous notification. In such cases, the broker
      does not error when it receives the
      <span class="code ">basic.cancel</span> and replies with a
      <span class="code ">basic.cancel-ok</span> as normal.
    </p>

      <div class="docSection"><a name="capabilities" id="capabilities"></a>
        <h2 class="docHeading">Client and Server Capabilities</h2>

        <p>
          The AMQP 0-8 specification defined a
          <span class="code ">capabilities</span> field as part of the
          <span class="code ">connection.open</span> method. This field was
          deprecated in the AMQP 0-9-1 specification and is not
          inspected by the RabbitMQ broker. As specified in AMQP 0-8,
          it also suffered from being a <span class="code ">shortstr</span>: a
          string of no more than 256 characters.
        </p>

        <p>
          There is good reason for both the client and the server
          being able to present extensions and capabilities that they
          support, thus we have introduced an alternative form of
          capabilities. In the <span class="code ">server-properties</span> field of
          <span class="code ">connection.start</span>, and in the
          <span class="code ">client-properties</span> field of
          <span class="code ">connection.start-ok</span>, the field value (a
          <span class="code ">peer-properties</span> table) can optionally contain a
          key named <span class="code ">capabilities</span> for which the value is
          another table, in which the keys name the capabilities
          supported. The values for these capability keys are
          typically booleans, indicating whether or not the capability
          is supported, but may vary based on the nature of the
          capability.
        </p>

        <p>
          For example, the <span class="code ">server-properties</span> presented by
          the RabbitMQ broker to a client may look like:

          <pre class="sourcecode">
{ "product"      = (longstr) "RabbitMQ",
  "platform"     = (longstr) "Erlang/OTP",
  "information"  = (longstr) "Licensed under the MPL.  See http://www.rabbitmq.com/",
  "copyright"    = (longstr) "Copyright (C) 2007-2011 VMware, Inc.",
  "capabilities" = (table)   { "exchange_exchange_bindings" = (bool) true,
                               "consumer_cancel_notify"     = (bool) true,
                               "basic.nack"                 = (bool) true,
                               "publisher_confirms"         = (bool) true },
  "version"      = (longstr) "2.4.0" }</pre>
        </p>

        <p>
          Note that it is optional for clients to present this
          <span class="code ">capabilities</span> table as part of the
          <span class="code ">client-properties</span> table: failure to present
          such a table does not preclude the client from being able to
          use extensions such as <a href="e2e.html">exchange
          to exchange bindings</a>. However, in some cases such as <a href="consumer-cancel.html">consumer cancellation
          notification</a>, the client must present the associated
          capability otherwise the broker will have no way of knowing
          that the client is capable of receiving the additional
          notifications.
