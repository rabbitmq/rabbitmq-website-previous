    <p>
      There are two flow control mechanisms in RabbitMQ. Both work by
      exerting TCP backpressure on connections that are publishing too
      fast. They are:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        A per-connection mechanism that prevents messages being
        published faster than they can be routed to queues.
      </li>
      <li>
        A global mechanism that prevents any messages from being
        published when the <a href="memory-use.html">memory usage</a>
        exceeds a configured threshold or free disk space drops
        below a configured threshold.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Both mechanisms will temporarily <em>block</em> connections -
      the server will pause reading from the sockets of connected
      clients which send content-bearing methods (such
      as <span class="code ">basic.publish</span>) which have been
      blocked. Connection heartbeat monitoring will be disabled too.
    </p>

    <p>
      The intent here is to introduce a flow control mechanism
      that throttles producers but lets consumers continue
      unaffected. However, since AMQP permits producers and
      consumers to operate on the same channel, and on different
      channels of a single connection, this logic is necessarily
      imperfect. In practice that does not pose any problems for
      most applications since the throttling is observable merely
      as a delay. Nevertheless, other design considerations
      permitting, it is advisable to only use individual AMQP
      connections for either producing or consuming.
    </p>

    <div class="docSection"><a name="per-connection" id="per-connection"></a>
      <h2 class="docHeading">Per-Connection Flow Control</h2>
      <p>
        RabbitMQ will block connections which are publishing too
        quickly for queues to keep up. No configuration is required.
      </p>
      <p>
        A blocked connection will show a <span class="code ">state</span>
        of <span class="code ">blocked</span> in <span class="code ">rabbitmqctl</span> and the
        management plugin HTTP API. Typically such fast-publishing
        connections will be blocked and unblocked several times per
        second, so inspecting a connection's <span class="code ">state</span> may
        not show per-connection flow control happening
        clearly. The <span class="code ">last_blocked_by</span>
        and <span class="code ">last_blocked_age</span> fields
        in <span class="code ">rabbitmqctl</span> and the management API can be
        inspected to determine whether flow control is taking place.
      </p>
      <p>
        The management plugin web UI unifies this information into a
        single field, showing <span class="code ">flow</span> for connections which
        have recently been in flow control.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="docSection"><a name="memsup" id="memsup"></a>
      <h2 class="docHeading">Memory-Based Flow Control</h2>
      <p>
        The RabbitMQ server detects the total amount of
        RAM installed in the computer on startup and when
        <span class="code ">rabbitmqctl
        set_vm_memory_high_watermark <em>fraction</em></span> is
        executed. By default, when the RabbitMQ server uses above 40%
        of the installed RAM, it raises a memory alarm and blocks all
        connections. Once the memory alarm has cleared (e.g. due
        to the server paging messages to disk or delivering them to
        clients) normal service resumes.
      </p>

      <p>
        When running RabbitMQ in a cluster, the memory alarm is
        cluster-wide; if one node goes over the limit then all nodes
        will block connections.
      </p>

      <p>
        The default memory threshold is set to 40% of installed
        RAM. Note that this does not prevent the RabbitMQ server
        from using more than 40%, it is merely the point at which
        publishers are throttled. Erlang's garbage collector can, in
        the worst case, cause double the amount of memory to be used
        (by default, 80% of RAM). It is strongly recommended that OS
        swap or page files are enabled.
      </p>

      <p>
        32-bit architectures tend to impose a per process memory limit
        of 2GB. Common implementations of 64-bit architectures
        (i.e. AMD64 and Intel EM64T) permit only a paltry 256TB per
        process. 64-bit Windows further limits this to 8TB. However,
        note that even under 64-bit OSes, a 32-bit process frequently
        only has a maximum address space of 2GB.
      </p>
      <div class="docSubsection"><a name="memsup-usage" id="memsup-usage"></a>
        <h3 class="docHeading">Configuring the Memory Threshold</h3>

        <p>
          The memory threshold at which the flow control is triggered
          can be adjusted by editing the <a href="configure.html#configuration-file">configuration
          file</a>.  The example below sets the threshold to the
          default value of 0.4:
          <pre class="sourcecode">[{rabbit, [{vm_memory_high_watermark, 0.4}]}].</pre>
        </p>

        <p>
          The default value of 0.4 stands for 40% of installed RAM or
          40% of available virtual address space, whichever is
          smaller. E.g. on a 32-bit platform, if you have 4GB of RAM
          installed, 40% of 4GB is 1.6GB, but 32-bit Windows normally
          limits processes to 2GB, so the threshold is actually to 40%
          of 2GB (which is 820MB).
        </p>

        <p>
          A value of <span class="code ">0</span> makes the memory alarm go off
          immediately and thus disables all publishing (this may be
          useful if you wish to disable publishing globally;
          use <span class="code ">rabbitmqctl set_vm_memory_high_watermark
            0</span>). To prevent the memory alarm from going off at all,
          set some high multiplier such as
          <span class="code ">100</span>.
        </p>

        <p>
          The memory limit is appended to the
          <b>RABBITMQ_NODENAME</b>.log file when the RabbitMQ server
          starts:
          <pre class="sourcecode">
=INFO REPORT==== 29-Oct-2009::15:43:27 ===
Memory limit set to 2048MB.</pre>
          The memory limit may also be queried using the
          <span class="code ">rabbitmqctl status</span> command.
        </p>

        <p>
          The threshhold can be changed while the broker is running
          using the <span class="code ">rabbitmqctl set_vm_memory_high_watermark
            <em>fraction</em></span> command. This command will take effect
          until the broker shuts down. The corresponding configuration
          setting should also be changed when the effects should survive
          a broker restart. The memory limit may change on systems with
          hot-swappable RAM when this command is executed without altering
          the threshhold, due to the fact that the total amount of system
          RAM is queried.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="docSubsection"><a name="address-space" id="address-space"></a>
        <h3 class="docHeading">Limited Address Space</h3>
        <p>
          When running RabbitMQ inside a 32 bit Erlang VM in a 64 bit
          OS, the addressable memory is limited. The server will
          detect this and log a message like:
        </p>

        <pre class="sourcecode">=WARNING REPORT==== 19-Dec-2013::11:27:13 ===
Only 2048MB of 12037MB memory usable due to limited address space.</pre>

        <p>
          The memory alarm system is not perfect. While stopping publishing
          will usually prevent any further memory from being used, it is quite
          possible for other things to continue to increase memory
          use. Normally when this happens and the physical memory is exhausted
          the OS will start to swap. But when running with a limited address
          space, running over the limit will cause the VM to crash.
        </p>

        <p>
          It is therefore strongly recommended that when running on a 64 bit
          OS you use a 64 bit Erlang VM.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="docSubsection"><a name="memsup-paging" id="memsup-paging"></a>
        <h3 class="docHeading">Configuring the Paging Threshold</h3>
        <p>
          Before the broker hits the high watermark and blocks
          publishers, it will attempt to free up memory by instructing
          queues to page their contents out to disc. Both persistent
          and transient messages will be paged out (the persistent
          messages will already be on disc but will be evicted from
          memory).
        </p>
        <p>
          By default this starts to happen when the broker is 50% of
          the way to the high watermark (i.e. with a default high
          watermark of 0.4, this is when 20% of memory is used). To
          change this value, modify
          the <span class="code ">vm_memory_high_watermark_paging_ratio</span>
          configuration from its default value
          of <span class="code ">0.5</span>. For example:
        </p>
        <pre class="sourcecode">[{rabbit, [{vm_memory_high_watermark_paging_ratio, 0.75},
           {vm_memory_high_watermark, 0.4}]}].</pre>
        <p>
          The above configuration starts paging at 30% of memory used, and
          blocks publishers at 40%.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is possible to
          set <span class="code ">vm_memory_high_watermark_paging_ratio</span> to a
          greater value than <span class="code ">1.0</span>. In this case queues
          will not page their contents to disc. If this causes the memory alarm 
          to go off, then producers will be blocked as explained above.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="docSubsection"><a name="memsup-unrecognised-platforms" id="memsup-unrecognised-platforms"></a>
        <h3 class="docHeading">Unrecognised platforms</h3>
        <p>
          If the RabbitMQ server is unable to recognise your system,
          it will append a warning to the
          <b>RABBITMQ_NODENAME</b>.log file. It then assumes than
          1GB of RAM is installed:
          <pre class="sourcecode">
=WARNING REPORT==== 29-Oct-2009::17:23:44 ===
Unknown total memory size for your OS {unix,magic_homebrew_os}. Assuming memory size is 1024MB.</pre>
        </p>

        <p>
          In this case, the <span class="code ">vm_memory_high_watermark</span>
          configuration value is used to scale the assumed 1GB
          RAM. With the default value of
          <span class="code ">vm_memory_high_watermark</span> set to 0.4,
          RabbitMQ's memory threshold is set to 410MB, thus it will
          throttle producers whenever RabbitMQ is using more than
          410MB memory. Thus when RabbitMQ can't recognize your
          platform, if you actually have 8GB RAM installed and you
          want RabbitMQ to throttle producers when the server is using
          above 3GB, set <span class="code ">vm_memory_high_watermark</span> to 3.
        </p>

        <p>
          It is advised you do not set the threshold above 50% of your
          installed RAM.
        </p>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="docSection"><a name="diskfreesup" id="diskfreesup"></a>
      <h2 class="docHeading">Disk-Based Flow Control</h2>
      <p>
        RabbitMQ can also block producers when free disk space drops
        below a certain limit. This is a good idea since even
        transient messages can be paged to disk at any time, and
        running out of disk space can cause the server to crash. By
        default RabbitMQ will block producers, and prevent
        memory-based messages from being paged to disk, when free disk
        space drops below 50MB. This will reduce but not eliminate the
        likelihood of a crash due to disk space being exhausted. In
        particular, if messages are being paged out rapidly it is
        possible to run out of disk space and crash in the time
        between two runs of the disk space monitor. A more
        conservative approach would therefore be to set the limit to
        the same as the amount of memory installed on the system (see
        below).
      </p>

      <p>
        Global flow control will be triggered if the amount of free disk
        space drops below a configured limit. The free space of the drive or
        partition that the broker database uses will be monitored every
        minute to determine whether the alarm should be raised or cleared.
        Monitoring will start as soon as the broker starts up, causing an entry
        in the broker logfile:
        <pre class="sourcecode">
=INFO REPORT==== 23-Jun-2012::14:52:41 ===
Disk free limit set to 953MB</pre>
        Monitoring will be disabled on unrecognised platforms, causing an
        entry such as the one below:
        <pre class="sourcecode">
=WARNING REPORT==== 23-Jun-2012::15:45:29 ===
Disabling disk free space monitoring</pre>
      </p>

      <p>
        When running RabbitMQ in a cluster, the disk alarm is
        cluster-wide; if one node goes under the limit then all nodes
        will block connections.
      </p>

      <p>
        RabbitMQ will periodically check the amount of free disk
        space. The frequency with which disk space is checked is related
        to the amount of space at the last check (in order to ensure
        that the disk alarm goes off in a timely manner when space is
        exhausted). Normally disk space is checked every 10 seconds, but
        as the limit is approached the frequency increases. When very
        near the limit RabbitMQ will check as frequently as 10 times per
        second. This may have some effect on system load.
      </p>

    <div class="docSubsection"><a name="diskfreesup-usage" id="diskfreesup-usage"></a>
      <h3 class="docHeading">Configuring the Disk Free Space Limit</h3>
      <p>
        The disk free space limit is configured with
        the <span class="code ">disk_free_limit</span> setting. By default 50MB is
        required to be free on the database partition. (See the description of
        <a href="/v3_2_x/relocate.html">file locations</a> for the default location).
        This configuration file sets the disk free space limit to 1GB:
        <pre class="sourcecode">[{rabbit, [{disk_free_limit, 1000000000}]}].</pre>
        It is also possible to set a free space limit relative to the RAM in the machine.
        This configuration file sets the disk free space limit to the same
        as the amount of RAM on the machine:
